The fact that many individuals nevertheless participate voluntarily in such elections suggests that people do care about democracy as such.

Using a model that addresses the prevalent endogeneity problem, which is likely to have discouraged similar research, we find that small fluctuations in income per-capita have significant inverse effects on the vote share of far-right parties. Our results explain the widespread success of such parties in entering European parliaments following the 2007–2008 crisis. They also suggest that,  ceteris paribus , far-right parties on the margin of electoral thresholds run the risk of losing parliamentary representation in the face of a steadily recovering world economy.', metadata={'title': 'Political extremism and economic activity', 'author': 'Matthew Rao, Paul A.

Subjects choose between two allocations that differ in payoffs and contributions to climate change mitigation. We vary the observability of the environmental contribution, as well as the decision context associated with different levels of pivotality. If the contribution is directly observable, we find evidence for lower pivotality leading to higher levels of “green” decisions, as predicted by the low-cost theory of voting. This effect disappears if subjects can avoid information on the contribution. Instead, we find evidence for the exploitation of moral wiggle room via information avoidance in larger democracies as well as in the consumption context. Our results indicate that information avoidance substitutes expressive voting as an instrument to manage cognitive dissonance on the part of the voter. Hence, moral biases in elections might be less likely than previously thought.', metadata={'title': 'Expressive voting versus information avoidance: experimental evidence in the context of climate change mitigation', 'author': 'Katharina Momsen, Markus Ohndorf', 'keywords': 'Expressive voting · Information avoidance · Experiment · Moral wiggle room · Climate change', 'filename': 'Expressive voting versus information avoidance_expenrimental evidence in the context of climate change mitigation.pdf'}),\n",
