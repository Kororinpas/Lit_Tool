Long- run growth depends not only on emission ﬂows but also on the assimilative capacity of the environment. The importance of environmental protection has brought emissions reductions to the awareness of policy makers in many developing countries. However, emissions reductions are usually tied to short-run growth cuts. In developing countries, where economic growth has been the focus, how can local bureaucrats be motivated to implement an emission control policy, and how would it aﬀect economic growth? This paper investigates how local bureaucrats respond to a performance evaluation system targeting emissions control in China. China has been the fastest-growing major economy over the past three decades, but this growth has come at the cost of heavy environmental pollution.1 The central government realized the pressing environmental issues and proposed a major policy initiative in 1998 to establish control zones in regions with the highest levels of sulfur emissions or acid rain. The main objective of the Two 1Twelve of the twenty most polluted cities in the world are located in China, and only 1% of the country’s 560 million city dwellers breathe air considered safe by the European Union (World Bank, 2007). The total economic cost of China’s air pollution was assessed at 4.1% of the GDP in 2002 (Wen and Chen, 2008), and the total economic loss of water and air pollution was evaluated at nearly 6.9% of the GDP in 2003 based on the willingness to pay approach (World Bank, 2007). China consistently ranks in the bottom quintile for ambient air quality according to the World Health Organization.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Control Zones (hereafter, TCZ) policy was to reduce SO2 emissions, which have long been a major contributor to China’s ambient air pollution.2 Contrary to the initial policy design, the eﬀect of the TCZ policy on SO2 emissions reductions was small and temporary. After a short dip in 1998-1999, SO2 emissions con- tinued to rise and reached a historical high in 2005-2006 (see Fig. 1).3 The unsuccessful implementation of the TCZ policy led the central government to reconsider its strategy. In 2005, new administrative regulations were imposed, and the emissions quota was in- cluded in the performance evaluation system for top local bureaucrats (city mayors and Party secretaries), making them subject to administrative sanction or removal from of- ﬁce if the quota was not met. This new administrative enforcement was the ﬁrst time that an emissions quota was included in the performance evaluation system and brought signiﬁcant changes to the lives of these local bureaucrats. [Insert Figure 1 here] For empirical analysis, we collected a rich set of data on 286 prefectural cities, among which 162 are TCZ cities and the rest are non-TCZ cities, and implement a diﬀerence-in- diﬀerences (DD) identiﬁcation framework. We ﬁnd that TCZ prefectural cities exhibited a similar pattern of reduction in SO2 emissions before 2005 compared to the control group (non-TCZ cities). After SO2 reductions became part of the performance measures in 2005, however, we ﬁnd that TCZ cities experience larger emissions reductions as they face more stringent reduction goals. In the meantime, we also ﬁnd that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates in TCZ cities signiﬁcantly decreased compared to that of the control group after the policy change. These results imply that the new evaluation system in 2005 introduced a substantial trade-oﬀ between SO2 emissions and GDP growth. A back of envelope calculation shows that for every 1 tonne of reduction in industrial SO2 emissions at city level, it’s GDP would be reduced by 190 thousand Chinese Yuan.4 A further welfare analysis suggests that the focal policy led to 833 lives saved, which is valued at 487.3 million in 1997 Chinese Yuan based on the World Bank’s valuation of a statistical life. The fact that the cost of the program exceeds its beneﬁt suggests that the Chinese government is willing to pay a premium for immediate and sizable reductions in 2The ambient concentration of SO2 in many Chinese cities was among the highest in the world when China’s coal consumption peaked in 1995. The damage from acid rain in the early 1990s was estimated to be about 0.7% of the GDP (World Bank, 1997). 3In Appendix Figure A.1, we further plot the time trends of SO2 emissions for TCZ and non-TCZ cities, respectively. However, due to the data availability, we can only start the analysis from 2001 onward (for data details, see Section 3.2). We ﬁnd similar upward increasing trends of SO2 emissions for TCZ and non-TCZ cities before 2005. After 2005, SO2 emissions stagnated in non-TCZ cities but declined in TCZ cities. 4To put this number into perspective, in 1999 the average emission charge on industrial SO2 at the national level was 46.37 Chinese Yuan per tonne (He, 2005). 2', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Our results are robust to a battery of speciﬁcation checks, such as a placebo test with a random assignment of TCZ cities, an alternative measurement of pollution reduction, a check on spatial spillover, the inclusion of a regional aggregate linear trend, a combination of DD and propensity score matching (PSM), the inclusion of time-varying controls, and the exclusion of large cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), as well as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities. To shed light on the substitution of eﬀorts between pollution reduction and economic development, we analyze the channels through which the policy was at work. In particu- lar, we closely examine the actual policies implemented by local bureaucrats in order to reduce SO2 emissions. By using detailed plant-level data from the electric power sector, we ﬁnd that most of the measures for reducing SO2 emissions were enforced by local bureaucrats, which explains the signiﬁcant drop in SO2 emissions in TCZ cities after 2005 compared with non-TCZ cities. Meanwhile, some of these measures (such as the closure and establishment restrictions on thermal power plants, control of growth in dirty sectors, etc.) had negative implications for economic development.5 We then conduct a thorough content analysis of each city government’s Annual Work of the Government Report from 2001 to 2015 to investigate how local bureaucrats revealed their eﬀorts for pollution reduction and economic growth. We ﬁnd that TCZ city governments became more concerned about environmental protection but had lower target GDP growth rates after 2005 than non-TCZ city governments. These results further indicate that local bureaucrats in TCZ cities were willing to trade oﬀ GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal. Our ﬁndings contribute to the literature in several ways. First, our paper adds new empirical evidence to the economics literature on incentivizing bureaucrats with concrete performance targets. Public management literature has long been trying to understand the eﬀect of a concrete performance target on the behaviors of local bureaucrats (OECD, 1994; Hood, 2007). In the economics literature, mixed evidence has been generated in previous studies. Lockwood and Porcelli (2013) show that the comprehensive perfor- mance assessment system in England has increased public service quality but has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on eﬃciency overall. Recent studies in Nigeria (Rasul and Rogger, 2015, 2017) suggest that concrete targets tend to decrease public service delivery.6 Our paper 5A dirty sector is deﬁned by matching the 2-digit industry classiﬁcation code to that of major SO2 pollution sectors identiﬁed by the China Pollution Source Census 2007. The 2007 census, the only pollution source census in China up to this date, examined 5.92 million pollution sources across all provinces in China. The ﬁnal report identiﬁed six industries (as shown in Appendix Table A.1) that rank the highest in terms of SO2 emissions share in total industrial SO2 emissions. These six industries comprise 88.5% of total SO2 industrial emissions. 6The failure of performance-based incentives is usually attributed to the multi-task nature of bureau- cratic jobs and bureaucrats’ intrinsic motives (Dixit, 2002; Alesina and Tabellini, 2008). As bureaucrats 3', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT provides empirical evidence for the eﬀectiveness of a concrete performance target in an environmental regulation setting. In particular, our results suggest that a target-based evaluation system can be eﬀective in motivating bureaucrats to shift their eﬀorts to- ward the tasks that are more heavily weighted by the evaluators and seek to achieve the targeted policy output. The magnitude of our estimates also suggests that bureaucrats appear to be willing to trade oﬀ substantial GDP growth for SO2 emissions reduction. Our paper adds to the understanding of multitasking agency problems for government agents. Career concern theories suggest that top bureaucrats are largely driven by the outcomes of their mandated tasks (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991; Dewatripont et al., 1999; Alesina and Tabellini, 2007, 2008). Under this framework, bureaucrats choose their eﬀort levels and their distribution of eﬀorts across tasks to maximize their signaled capa- bility to the market (or the principal). Speciﬁcally, our results speak to two theoretical predictions made by Wilson (1989), Dewatripont et al. (1999) and Dewatripont et al. (2000). The ﬁrst prediction is that bureaucrats’ accountability increases as their mis- sion becomes more “focused”and “clear”. Compared to the initial establishment of the TCZ in 1998, the new administrative policy in 2005 brought more clarity to the local bureaucrats’ mission agenda. And this narrowly deﬁned goal increases eﬀorts exerted by bureaucrats for controlling emissions. Our results support this prediction by show- ing that local bureaucrats implemented a series of policies that speciﬁcally targeted SO2 emissions reduction after the administrative enforcement. The second prediction that relates to our results is that when eﬀort is encouraged on one task, eﬀorts on other tasks would decrease. Our results show that compared to non-TCZ cities, real GDP growth signiﬁcantly decreases in TCZ cities after the new administrative policy was in place in 2005, indicating a shift of attention from GDP growth to emissions control by local bureaucrats. Our paper addresses an important yet relatively neglected topic in the environmental economics literature for developing countries - the empirical relationship between strin- gent environmental regulations and GDP growth. The eﬀect of environmental regulations on growth mainly stems from three channels. The ﬁrst is the direct cost of regulations. For example, in 2015, the total government expenditure on environmental protection among the European Union member countries amounted to 0.4% of the GDP (EuroStat, 2017), and the Chinese government designated 7.5 billion U.S. dollars for environmental protection in 2017 (MEPC, 2017). Diverting government resources towards enforcement and compliance of environmental regulations would potentially hurt economic growth. Secondly, regulations might lead to shutdowns of certain plants and thus unemployment. usually juggle multiple tasks or multiple dimensions of a task, concrete performance targets potentially cause social distortion by requiring bureaucrats to exert eﬀort on less productive outcomes (Rasul and Rogger, 2017). Emphasizing output as a performance measure would also likely crowd out the intrinsic motivations for bureaucrats (Benabou and Tirole, 2003). 4', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Empirical evidence in the U.S. suggests that stringent regulations result in signiﬁcant job loss in both the short and long run (Greenstone, 2012; Walker, 2013). The third channel is ﬁrm competitiveness. Conventional economic theories suggest that, at the ﬁrm level, stringent environmental regulations result in the relocation of resources from more pro- ductive activities to pollution abatement, and they decrease productivity (Xepapadeas, 2005). The opposite view, as suggested by Porter and van der Linde (1995), argues that in the long run, improved eﬃciency and innovation might increase productivity due to technological enhancements.7 Empirical literature on the relationship between en- vironmental regulations and economic growth is rather limited in developing countries. Existing studies usually focus on estimating regulations’ impacts on ﬁrm competitiveness (Yuan et al., 2017; Wang and Shen, 2016; Zhao et al., 2015). At the aggregate level, less is known about the impact on economic growth. Our results address this gap by directly estimating the eﬀect of a stringent environmental regulation on GDP growth. We show that bringing a SO2 emissions cut to the performance evaluation system leads to a 0.846 percentage point drop in GDP growth per annum.8 Our results indicate that the impact of environmental regulations on GDP growth can be both signiﬁcant and long lasting. Our ﬁndings also contribute to the small but growing literature on what motivates local governments to adopt more stringent environmental policies. Rigor and willing- ness to implement environmental regulation at the local government level are usually associated with political connections, promotion probability and other political concerns (Zheng et al., 2014; Jin and Lin, 2014; Kahn et al., 2015).9 Our paper shows that the readiness of the central government to reward and punish local oﬃcials based on their environmental performance could also motivate local government oﬃcials to reach the green goal.10 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the policy background on the TCZ policy and performance evaluation system. We 7Empirical studies have provided inclusive evidence for the Porter Hypothesis. For example, a recent meta-analysis, which was conducted by Cohen and Tubb (2017), showed that environmental regulations display heterogeneous impact on productivity at the ﬁrm and industrial level. The impact size was signiﬁcantly correlated with the types of regulations imposed. 8To put this number into perspective, Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1990) showed that the aggregate impact of environmental regulation on U.S. economic growth in the 1980s was about 0.191 percentage point. 9Zheng et al. (2014) show that a city mayor’s environmental performance is related to his or her promotion probability. Jin and Lin (2014) focus on explaining the relationship between political con- nections and environmental pollution. She suggests that local governments are possibly motivated by their environmental concerns. Kahn et al. (2015) study the behavior of local governments when they are incentivized to reduce water pollution and provide a mechanism that can resolve cross-border pollution. Our paper focuses on evaluating the impact of a public management incentive system. Although all these papers address environmental pollution and promotion in China, the research questions and focus are very diﬀerent. 10Our results complement and echo the literature evaluating the target-based vertical control system (see Xu (2011) for a review). 5', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Mechanisms and welfare analyses are presented in sections 5 and 6. 2. Policy background 2.1. Administrative Enforcement of SO2 Reductions Targets SO2 emissions have long been a major contributor to China’s ambient air pollution, and reducing SO2 emissions has been a priority for China’s environmental authorities since the 1990s. Beginning with the 9th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 1996 to 2000) in 1996, China’s central government began to set limits on total SO2 emissions. In 1998, the State Council instituted an SO2 reduction program (henceforth referred to as the 1998 policy) to limit ambient SO2 pollution and to curb the growing incidence of acid rain. The 1998 policy encompassed two target policy areas: the SO2 Control Zone, covering cities in North China, and the Acid Rain Control Zone, covering cities in South China. In aggregate, the TCZ regions cover 11% of China’s territory (see Fig. 2) and are responsible for more than 60% of China’s total SO2 emissions.11 The 1998 policy also laid out long- term SO2 emissions reduction goals. Speciﬁcally, it stated that by 2000, SO2 emissions from TCZ cities should be under the quota set by the central government.12 By 2010, SO2 emissions should not be higher than 2000 levels, and air quality in major TCZ cities needs to meet the national standard by 2010 (SO2 air concentration below 60 µg/m3). To reach the total SO2 emissions reduction targets (also known as the green goal ), the Chinese central government imposed nationwide emissions quotas in 2000, with more stringent measures applied to TCZ cities. A total emissions control policy was incorporated into China’s 10th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 2001 to 2005) in 2001 to work in concert with the TCZ policy.13 [Insert Figure 2 here] However, the implementation of the TCZ policy was not successful. The eﬀect of the TCZ policy on SO2 emissions reductions was small and temporary. Although total SO2 emissions leveled oﬀ between 1997 and 2002, they quickly picked up speed afterward. By 2005, the total emissions level had not declined but instead, had increased by 28% from the 2000 level (see Fig. 1). To force localities to adhere to the national policy, administrative enforcement was put into place by the end of 2005 (henceforth also referred to as the 2005 policy) as part of the 11th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 2006 to 2010). Starting in Dec 2005, local 11The relevant Chinese document for the TCZ policy is available at the following government website: http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/wj/200910/t20091022_172231.htm 12The actual SO2 emissions in 1995 was 23.7 million tons. The target SO2 emissions for 2000 set by the central government was 24.6 million tons. 13The relevant Chinese document for the 10th 5-Year Plan guideline for the TCZ policy is available at the following government website: http://www.ynepb.gov.cn/xxgk/read.aspx?newsid=11012. 6', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

A follow- up announcement was made by the central government in 2007 speciﬁcally about the emissions reductions targets, which emphasized that the SO2 emissions reduction targets to be attained by the end of 2010 would be incorporated into the responsibility contracts signed with upper-level governments. After the central government imposed the administrative enforcement at the end of 2005, the central government’s consistent emphasis on the need to reduce SO2 emissions has made it incrementally more diﬃcult for local governments and polluters to drag their feet in carrying out the central government’s SO2 emissions reduction policy. By 2010, the SO2 emissions reduction targets were ﬁnally met, and an overall 14.29% reduction was achieved nationwide (see Fig. 1). The target-based performance system was carried through the 12th Five-Year Plan (i.e., 2011-2015) and by 2015, a further national total SO2 emissions reduction target of 8% was also achieved. 2.2. SO2 emissions reductions and career concerns In this subsection, we discuss a conceptual framework and present descriptive evidence for the link between the target-based performance evaluation system and emissions reduc- tions. Following the seminal work by Dewatripont et al. (1999) and Alesina and Tabellini (2008), bureaucrats are partly motivated by their career concerns. Speciﬁcally, career concern theories suggest that top bureaucrats are largely driven by the outcomes of their mandated tasks. Under this framework, bureaucrats choose their eﬀort levels and their distribution of eﬀorts across tasks to maximize their signaled capability to the non-public sectors. In addition to career motives, studies show that bureaucrats are motivated by peer pressure, social norms and bureaucrats’ own glow of warmth (Wilson, 1989; Maskin and Tirole, 2004). In China, the most important career concern for bureaucrats is to move up the hierar- 14The relevant Chinese document is available at the following government website: http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2005-12/13/content 125680.htm 15In the meantime, the central government banned new construction projects in regions with un- satisfactory SO2 emissions reductions, in an eﬀort to align incentives for economic growth with local governments’ achievement of the green goal. Given that the achievement rate of the SO2 emissions tar- get was very high (i.e., 98% for the TCZ cities; see Table 1), the policy was not binding. Nonetheless, to alleviate the concern that our estimates may be caused by the banning of new construction projects, we conduct a robustness check by including the logarithm of ﬁxed investment per capita in Appendix Table A.2, column 1. We ﬁnd that our estimates are robust to this control, further suggesting that our results are not aﬀected by the banning policy. 7', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Since the economic reform in the 1970s, the central government has been incentivizing local governments to “get rich ﬁrst.” The GDP growth has been the most important evaluation criterion for local bureaucrats in China. Empirical evidence suggests that the promotions and bonuses of local bureaucrats are highly correlated with regional GDP growth (e.g., Li and Zhou, 2005). The 2005 policy was the ﬁrst time that a pollution emissions quota was explicitly men- tioned in the performance evaluation criteria. Given that this policy contained signiﬁcant measures for promotion, SO2 emissions reductions became one of the most important fac- tors in the assessment of local cadres.16 Local government leaders who fail to meet the annual SO2 emissions reduction targets would be penalized with an administrative sanc- tion or removal from oﬃce.17 The administrative enforcement ensures the eﬀectiveness of the TCZ policy across the chessboard of China’s territorial administration, and further ties local cadres to their fulﬁllment of the target SO2 emissions reductions. Table 1 presents the emissions reductions goals for the 11th (i.e., from 2006 to 2010) and 12th Five-Year Plans (i.e., from 2011 to 2015), as well as the average achievement rate. We present the numbers for TCZ and non-TCZ cities, separately. The information was compiled by the authors from various government documents to cover as many cities in our sample as possible. Note that although the reduction goals for TCZ cities are much more aggressive than those for non-TCZ cities, the achievement rates are much higher in TCZ cities. The average achievement rate for TCZ cities has remained at 98% since 2005. We cannot provide direct evidence for the link between removal from oﬃce with failing to achieve emissions reduction goals, as local bureaucrats could be removed from oﬃce for multiple reasons (corruption, scandals etc.). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the veto power mentioned in the policy was eﬀective. For example, during a press release conference held by the State Council Information Oﬃce, a government oﬃcial mentioned that the veto power is a signal from the central government that pollution control is no longer a hand-waving gesture but something the government really cares about. It is also 16Other important performance measures for local bureaucrats include GDP growth, implementation of the One Child Policy and fatal accidents etc.. GDP growth has been shown to be highly correlated with promotions and bonuses for local bureaucrats (Chen et al., 2005). Fatal accidents as a measure of performance were ﬁrst brought up in a provision issued by the central government in 2001, which declared that “when an extremely fatal accident happens, the local government oﬃcials would be penalized based on the severity of the accident.”This measure is important because it is tied to the economic development and stability of society that the Party has been trying to achieve. The One Child Policy has been declared as the “basic state policy” since the late 1970s and was closely tied to performance evaluations of local bureaucrats (Feng et al., 2013). 17The relevant Chinese document is available at the following government website: http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2007-06/03/content 634545.htm 8', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

To achieve the emissions reductions goals set by the Five- Year plans, local bureaucrats weigh the pollution reduction against GDP growth. In the following sections, we formally investigate and quantify the eﬀect of the target-based performance evaluation system in the 2005 policy on emissions reductions and economic growth. Meanwhile, we also conduct a welfare analysis of the policy. 3. Estimation strategy 3.1. Estimation framework To investigate whether the performance-based evaluation system based on SO2 emis- sions reduction introduced in 2005 aﬀects government oﬃcials’ behavior in implementing environmental regulations and promoting economic growth, we conduct a DD analysis by comparing outcomes in TCZ cities (those cities with strict environmental regulations) iswith those of non-TCZ cities before and after 2005. Speciﬁcally, our regression equation yct = βTCZc ∗ Post05t + δc + γt + Zc ∗ f(t) + εct, (1) where yct contains our outcomes of concern (logarithm of the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate) in city c at year t; TCZc equals 1 if city c was designated a TCZ city in 1998 and 0 otherwise; Post05t takes a value of 1 if t > 2005 and 0 otherwise; δc is the city ﬁxed eﬀect, capturing all time-invariant diﬀerences across cities; γt is year ﬁxed eﬀect, capturing all yearly factors that are common to cities such as macro-level shocks; Zc denotes the determinants of TCZ selection measured in the pre-treatment period and f(t) is a third-order polynomial function (both explained later); and εct is the error term. To accommodate potential heteroskadesticity and serial correlation, we cluster the standard errors at the city level, following the suggestion by Bertrand et al. (2004). We expect β to be negative for the outcome of SO2 emissions (in the logarithm) if the performance-based evaluation system is eﬀective, as TCZ cities were subject to a larger emissions reductions target in 2000. Thus the new evaluation system introduced in 2005 would induce more reductions in TCZ cities. Meanwhile, we also expect β to be negative for the GDP growth rate as after the 2005 policy, local bureaucrats would reallocate eﬀorts 18The relevant interview information is available at http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/ 2007/1129/Document/324843/324843.htm 9', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT from promoting growth to reducing pollution given the substantial career consequences of the policy.19 However, the unbiased estimation of β requires that the logarithm of SO2 emissions and GDP growth in TCZ cities would have followed the same time trend as those in non- TCZ cities after 2005 if a performance-based evaluation system had not been imposed by the central government in 2005. A primary threat to our identifying assumption is that cities were not randomly selected into TCZ and non-TCZ groups in 1998. This non-random selection implies that TCZ and non-TCZ cities could have been systemati- cally diﬀerent before 1998. If the values of these unobserved diﬀerences changed in 2005, then our estimate would be biased. To address this concern, we follow an approach used by Gentzkow (2006), in which key determinants of the TCZ selection are ﬁrst identi- ﬁed and then post-treatment variations in the outcome variable generated by these key determinants are ﬂexibly controlled in the regression. The premise of this approach is that conditional on these key determinants, the central government did not select TCZ cities based on remaining unobservables with a perspective that there would be a new performance-based evaluation system eight years later and these remaining unobservables would behave diﬀerently for TCZ and non-TCZ cities at that time. Given that the designation of TCZ cities was initiated by the central government in the mid-1990s, we look at government policy documents to understand the factors that shaped the government’s decision-making processes for selecting TCZ cities. Speciﬁcally, according to the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law (APPCL) amended in 1995, based on conditions in the atmosphere, terrain and soil, cities could be designated as either an SO2 Control Zone or an Acid Rain Control Zone. In addition, the 1998 TCZ policy classiﬁed those cities that were already seriously polluted by SO2 or acid rain as TCZ cities. We collected two sets of variables as our TCZ selection variables. The ﬁrst set of variables reﬂects the conditions of the natural environment based on the 1995 APPCL amendment: Roughness (the standard deviation of slope), Elevation (average elevation in kilometers), Wind Speed (annual average wind speed in 1990-1995), Precipitation (an- nual average precipitation in 1990-1995) and Soil pH (average pH level of topsoil). The second set of variables reﬂects pre-policy SO2 pollution levels, which include Coldness (percentage of days with a temperature of 5oC or below in 1990-1995) and the total employment in dirty sectors in 1996.20 To ﬂexibly control for trends in SO2 emissions 19Policies implemented that target SO2 emissions reduction would also induce a mechanical trade-oﬀ between emissions and GDP growth. 20Ideally we should include pre-policy SO2 levels as a determinant for TCZ designation for each city, but unfortunately, the data are not available. Therefore, we use pollutants that are known to be highly correlated with SO2 and employees in the dirty sector as a proxy for baseline SO2 (see footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors.). When the daily outdoor temperature drops to 5◦C or below for a few days, the northern region of China enters the heating period. As a result, coal combustion in boilers is associated with the release of air pollutants that are highly correlated with SO2. 10', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

It is possible that the implementation of the TCZ policy itself could have altered the characteristics of the treatment and control groups so that they became incomparable when the target-based evaluation system was in place by the end of 2005. Speciﬁcally, existing studies have shown that the implementation of the TCZ policy in 1998 aﬀected foreign investment (Cai et al., 2016), exports (Hering and Poncet, 2014) and health (Tanaka, 2015). To address this concern, we add a set of variables that are known in the literature to be aﬀected by the TCZ policy: speciﬁcally, city-level foreign direct investment (FDI), mortality and export sales data, interacted with Post05.21 Appendix Table A.3 shows the balancing between TCZ and non-TCZ cities to shed light on whether controlling for TCZ selection variables improves the matching between our treatment and control groups. Panel A shows the seven selection variables. We ﬁnd that TCZ and non-TCZ cities diﬀered signiﬁcantly in many of these variables, such as the percentage of days with a temperature of 5oC or below in 1990-1995, annual wind speed in 1990-1995, total employment in dirty sectors in 1996, and annual average precipitation in 1990-1995. Panel B compares TCZ and non-TCZ cities on various economic and social development variables in the ﬁrst year in our sample (i.e., 2001).22 We ﬁnd that without controlling for TCZ selection variables, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in initial con- ditions between TCZ and non-TCZ cities. However, once conditional on TCZ selection variables, the diﬀerences becomes statistically and economically insigniﬁcant. These re- sults indicate that our treatment and control groups are balanced with the controls of TCZ selection variables, which is crucial for our identiﬁcation. As further checks on our identifying assumption in equation 1, we conduct several sen- sitivity exercises, including an event study of whether the outcome variables had similar pre-treatment trends between TCZ and non-TCZ cities, a placebo test with the random assignment of TCZ cities, an alternative measurement of pollution reduction, a check on spatial spillover, the inclusion of the regional aggregate linear trend, a combination of DD and PSM, the inclusion of time-varying controls, and the exclusion of large cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, etc.) as well as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities.

The city-level industrial SO2 emissions data were collected from the provincial-level China Statistical Yearbooks, supplemented by the China City Statistical Yearbooks 2004-2016 and China Environmental Yearbooks 2002-2016.23 We use emissions data between 2001 and 2015 for the analyses presented in this paper. Data before 2001 were subject to signiﬁcant missing values, and thus were not included in the study. The city-level annual industrial SO2 emissions were calculated by summing up emissions from all reporting ﬁrms in a given year. The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) records each reporting ﬁrm’s SO2 emissions through direct monitoring. If direct monitoring is not feasible, the SEPA uses reverse engineering measures computed from the industrial waste reported by the ﬁrm. The list of reporting ﬁrms is determined by the SEPA and covers more than 85% of the major polluting ﬁrms in the city, and is subject to minor revisions each year. The monitoring process follows a strict protocol and is subject to internal auditing processes. It is very unlikely that the data were systemically manipulated via collusion between SEPA oﬃcials and local bureaucrats. Data on city-level real annual GDP growth rate were collected from the China Statistical Yearbooks for Regional Economy, supplemented by the provincial- level China City Statistical Yearbooks 2004-2016 and the China Statistical Yearbooks.

Soil pH data were extracted from the grid data of the Global Dataset of Derived Soil Properties at 0.5 degree by 0.5 degree. Data on total employees in the dirty sectors are from the China Establishment Census 1996.

The dataset covers the universe of all export transactions by Chinese exporters. Speciﬁcally, it includes product information (at the HS 8-digit level), trade value, identity of Chinese exporters, and export destinations. We ﬁrst match the HS classiﬁcation to the Chinese Industry Classiﬁcation using the concordance table from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. We then aggregate the export value from the 8-digit HS-product level to the 2-digit industry and city levels. 23According to the China Pollution Source Census 2007, industrial activity is responsible for 91.4% of total SO2 emissions. The remaining 8.6% is contributed by domestic activity. 24See footnote 5 for deﬁnition of dirty sectors. 12', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Main results 4.1. Baseline estimates Table 3 reports the main results from equation 1. Column 1 presents results from a simple DD estimation for SO2 emissions with only the city and year ﬁxed eﬀects included. The interaction between TCZc and Post05t is negative and statistically signiﬁcant, sug- gesting that SO2 emissions fell more signiﬁcantly in TCZ cities than in non-TCZ cities after 2005. Given that the TCZ policy imposed stricter regulations on SO2 emissions in TCZ cities than in non-TCZ cities, and that a performance-based evaluation system was imposed in 2005, this result implies that the new evaluation system has disciplined or incentivized bureaucrats to enforce the environmental regulations. [Insert Table 3 here] To alleviate the concern that our estimate is biased due to the non-random selection of TCZ cities in 1998, we include interactions between determinants of TCZ selection and a third-order polynomial function of time in column 2. We continue to ﬁnd a neg- ative and statistically signiﬁcant estimate of TCZc ∗ Post05t. In column 3, we further include three interactions between Y ear05t and FDI, mortality and dirty export sales, respectively, to address the concern that the TCZ policy in 1998 made TCZ and non-TCZ cities non-comparable before 2005. We continue to ﬁnd a negative and statistically signif- icant coeﬃcient. In Appendix Table A.2, column 2, we estimate the policy eﬀect on the level of SO2 emissions, and uncover a negative coeﬃcient, despite the lack of statistical signiﬁcance due to the large standard errors. In columns 4 to 6, Table 3, we examine the eﬀect of the new performance evaluation system on GDP growth. Column 4 reports estimation from the baseline DD with only the city and year ﬁxed eﬀects. Columns 5 and 6 report results when more controls are included. We ﬁnd negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcients of the interaction between TCZc and Post05t across all speciﬁcations. These results indicate that the new evaluation system has led to a signiﬁcant decrease in economic growth. Economic magnitude. To gauge the economic signiﬁcance of our estimates, we report the control means in Table 3.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT a reduction in the level of SO2 emissions by 14.6%. Given that the control mean of the logarithm of SO2 emissions is 1.338 (which implies a level of SO2 emissions as 3.811 with a unit of 10,000 tonnes), our estimate suggests that the policy leads to a decrease in SO2 emissions by 3.811 × 0.146 × 10000 = 5, 564 tonnes. For the GDP growth rate, our estimate in column 6 shows that the policy reduces the GDP growth rate by 0.846 percentage point. With the control mean of annual growth rate at 12.17%, this number suggests that the 2005 policy reduced the annual GDP growth rate by 0.846/12.17 = 6.9%. 4.2. Robustness checks Our estimates hinge on the identifying assumption that cities designated to be a TCZ in 1997 would not have had diﬀerential trends in SO2 emissions or GDP growth starting in 2005. To further verify that our identifying assumption is sustained, in this section, we report a battery of robustness checks. Time trends before the treatment. A necessary condition for satisfying our identifying assumption is that TCZ and non-TCZ cities have similar time trends in the outcomes before the treatment. Speciﬁcally, if similar time trends existed for a long period before the treatment and diverged after the treatment, it may indicate that the diﬀerential trends may be caused by the treatment. To this end, we apply an event study approach along the lines described by Jacobson et al. (1993). Speciﬁcally, we estimate the following equation yct = 2015 � t=2001 βtTCZc ∗ γt + δc + γt + Zc ∗ f(t) + εct, (2) in which βt is a series of estimates from 2001 to 2015. In particular, with the omitted time category being 2005, {βt} captures the diﬀerences in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities relative to the diﬀerence just before the policy launch. Fig. 3a plots the estimates for the outcome of SO2 reduction along with the 95% conﬁdence interval. We ﬁnd that the estimates are positive and are stable in the magni- tudes from 2001 to 2004, suggesting a common trend between TCZ and non-TCZ cities before the treatment. The estimates for the GDP growth rate are plotted in Fig. 3b. Despite some ﬂuctuations, all the estimates were positive from 2001 to 2004 without a clear trend. [Insert Figures 3a and 3b here] Figs 3a and 3b also allow us to visualize the marginal eﬀect of the 2005 policy by year. In Fig 3a, the diﬀerence dropped to negative immediately after the adoption of the treatment in 2005 and continued to be negative with increasing magnitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the policy change in 2005 generated the diﬀerential 14', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

In Fig. 3b, interestingly, the estimates for 2006 and 2007 were also positive and similar in magnitude to those in the pre-treatment period, and they became negative since 2008. These results suggest some lagging eﬀects of the 2005 policy change on the GDP growth rate. A placebo test with randomization of the treatment. As a second robustness check, we randomly draw 162 cities out of the total of 286 cities in our sample and assign TCZ status TCZfalse c to these cities. Similarly, we randomly assign the timing of the adoption of the new performance-based evaluation system Postfalse t to these cities, and then construct a new regressor of interest TCZfalse c × Postfalse t . Given this random data-generating process, a necessary condition for satisfying our identifying assumption is that TCZfalse c ×Postfalse t shall produce zero policy eﬀect on the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate; otherwise, it indicates that our estimation equation is misspeciﬁed. To increase the power of this test, we conduct the random assignment 1,000 times. The distributions of 1,000 estimated coeﬃcients for the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate are plotted in Appendix Figures A.2(a) and A.2(b), respectively. Both distributions are narrowly centered around zero, and less than 1% of the estimates are more negative than our true baseline estimates in Table 3. These graphs provide further support for our identiﬁcation strategy.25 Inclusion of regional linear time trend. To control for the aggregate time trend, we insert the regional linear time trend in our baseline equation (1), i.e., λr × t, where the regions include Northeast, East, Central and West China. Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 1, with panel A for SO2 emissions and panel B for the GDP growth rate. We ﬁnd consistent estimates, suggesting that our estimates are not aﬀected by the aggregate trends. [Insert Table 4 here] Exclusion of large cities and Summer Olympic Games venue cities. Cities in China diﬀer in hierarchical signiﬁcance. In particular, our regression sample includes four mu- nicipalities directly under central government control (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqin). Meanwhile, the 2008 Summer Olympic Games were held in China, which had signiﬁcant impacts on the economy and society. To examine whether our estimates are driven by these municipalities and the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities, we exclude them and re-estimate the equation. Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 2. We again ﬁnd similar results, suggesting that our results are not driven by inﬂuential cities. Spatial spillovers.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT TCZ cities would also be aﬀected by the new evaluation system, as polluting ﬁrms could be easily moved from TCZ to non-TCZ cities that border each other. To rule out this possibility, we exclude non-TCZ cities bordering TCZ cities in the analysis. As shown in Table 4, column 3, the estimated coeﬃcients for SO2 emissions and GDP growth rate remain negative and statistically signiﬁcant. These results provide evidence that our results are not driven by bordering cities. An alternative measurement of pollution reduction. Note that SO2 emissions data were monitored and collected by the SEPA. The whole process followed a strict protocol and was subject to internal auditing, making it diﬃcult for local bureaucrats to manipulate the data. However, one may still be concerned that there might be some collusion between SEPA oﬃcials and local bureaucrats, and the SO2 emissions data were inaccurate. To address this concern, we use PM2.5 as an alternative measure of SO2 emissions. PM2.5 particles can be directly emitted or produced from emitted precursors. Pollutants such as SO2, nitrate and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can react in the atmosphere to produce PM2.5. Although changes in PM2.5 can be a complicated process, PM2.5 can be used as a good alternative measure for SO2 emissions (Hoden and Barnard, 2015). In our setting, we ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.22 between the logarithm of the SO2 emissions and the logarithm of PM2.5. The PM2.5 data were extracted from the grid data of Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MISR) Aerosol Optical Depth, which provides a continuous surface of concentrations of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller.26 The grid data were derived by researchers in the U.S. from satellite data provided by NASA; thus, the source of the PM2.5 data is completely independent of the SO2 emissions levels reported by the SEPA. Estimation results of the policy eﬀect on PM2.5 particles are reported in Table 4, column 4. The estimated coeﬃcient is negative and statistically signiﬁcant. A decrease in PM2.5 as a result of the 2005 policy, in the absence of regulations for the other reactors, supports our hypothesis that the policy eﬀectively reduced SO2 emissions. Inclusion of additional time-varying city characteristics. The inclusion of Zc ∗ f(t) in Table 3, column 2 shows a signiﬁcant drop in the estimated magnitude (i.e., about 36%). As Zc ∗ f(t) controls for the ﬂexible time trends in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities due to the diﬀerences in initial conditions, the drop in magnitude may imply that the time-varying characteristics of the TCZ and non-TCZ cities diﬀer. To address this concern, we further include several time-varying city characteristics such as log GDP per capita, share of manufacturing sectors, coal abundance and trade intensity. 26The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes and cover the world from 70◦N to 60◦S latitude. 16', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

We continue to ﬁnd a negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimate, with the decrease in magnitude about 24%. These results conﬁrm that our selection of time-varying city characteristics capture important diﬀerential trends in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities. We then further add these time-varying controls to our baseline regression shown equation (1) (that is, along with the cubic time trends of the initial conditions). Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 5. Our results remain robust to these additional controls, lending further support to our identiﬁcation. Matched DD estimation. As a further robustness check, we combine our DD estima- tion with a PSM strategy. Speciﬁcally, we match for each TCZ city, to a non-TCZ city based on seven key criteria that the central government used to determine TCZ cities. These variables include roughness, elevation, wind speed, precipitation, soil pH level, coldness and dirty sector employment.27 The estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 6. We continue to ﬁnd negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimates for the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate from this combined DD and PSM estimation framework, implying the robustness of our ﬁndings. 4.3. Non-targeted pollutants Our results show that the new evaluation system in 2005 introduced a substantial trade-oﬀ between SO2 emissions and GDP growth. One possible explanation for the observed policy eﬀect is that the new system made bureaucrats more concerned about the reduction in SO2 emissions (the policy-targeted pollutant) and shifted their eﬀorts away from economic development. It would then be interesting to investigate when the eﬀorts were redistributed into environmental protection in general, or were they placed on the policy-targeted pollutant only. To this end, we examine the top pollutants outlined by the China Pollution Source Census 2007. Speciﬁcally, according to the Census, the four major air pollutants in China are SO2, soot, NOx and dust. As no reliable national data are available for the latter two, we include the analysis of the 2005 policy eﬀect on soot. We further estimate the policy eﬀect on other two other non-target pollutants: CO2 and waster water. If the policy works by incentivizing bureaucrats to target at SO2 emissions only, then should we not expect to see any policy eﬀect on these non-targeted pollutants. Speciﬁcally, data for waste water discharge were collected from the annual statistical yearbooks of the Chinese provinces, supplemented by the Chinese City Statistical Year- books 2004-2014 and Chinese Environmental Yearbooks 2002-2014. Data on soot were 27See footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors. 17', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Estimation results are reported in Table 5. None of the three estimated coeﬃcients are statistically signiﬁcant. We further test whether the regression coeﬃcients reported in Table 5 are equal to those reported in column 3, Table 3. Test statistics are reported in Panel B, Table 5. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the policy impacts on Log(Soot) are equal to those on Log(SO2). However, our results do suggest that the policy impacts on Log(CO2) and Log(wastewater) are diﬀerent from those on Log(SO2), as shown in columns 2 and 3 in Panel B, Table 5. Note that the polluting sources for SO2 are very diﬀerent from CO2 and wastewater but similar to soot, particularly for industrial SO2 and soot emissions. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that local bureaucrats, who are motivated by their career concerns, care only about policy-targeted pollution reductions instead of the overall environmental improvement. [Insert Table 5 here] 5. Mechanisms Our analysis shows that the 2005 policy (which included the SO2 emissions reduction in the bureaucrat promotion consideration) caused a signiﬁcant fall in the SO2 emissions and in the GDP growth rate. In this section, we explore mechanisms through which this policy was at work to shed light on the substitution of eﬀorts between pollution reduction and economic development. 5.1. Policy measures The 2005 policy included a series of measures to meet the emissions reduction tar- gets in the TCZ cities, such as the closure of high SO2 concentration coal mines, the increasing control of SO2 emissions from thermal power plants and industrial boilers, and the introduction of more energy-saving and low pollution technologies (Cao et al., 2009). Local government oﬃcials in China have administrative powers over state-owned industrial sectors. Per the second China National Economic Census of 2008, over 51.1% of power plants are owned by the state. These power plants comprise more than 77.8% of workers in the entire power plant sector and 81.4% of the sector’s total capital. For state-owned power plants, city mayors and secretaries determine whether or not to op- erate these plants as well as plant locations and operating capacity. In the remainder of this section, we will analyse ﬁve policy measures that are related to the operations of power plants. If it is shown that these measures were more eﬀectively enforced by local 18', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

One measure is to install desulfurization facilities in the thermal power plants to contain their emissions, which are one of the major sources of SO2 emissions. To this end, we collect desulfu- rization data for thermal power plants from the Compilation of Statistical Materials of Electric Power Industry 2001-2010. This dataset covers all thermal power plants with an installed capacity of 6,000 KW and above, and accounts for more than 99% of all fossil-fuel power electricity generation capacity in China.29 There are a total of 2210 power plants in our sample, averaged at 7.7 plants per city.30 Firm-level estimation re- sults are reported in Table 6, column 1. We ﬁnd a positive and statistically signiﬁcant coeﬃcient, indicating that after the new evaluation system in 2005, thermal power plants increased their desulfurization rates (measured as the rate of desulfurization facilities over total facilities). These results suggest that this measure for reducing SO2 emissions was implemented by local bureaucrats. [Insert Table 6 here] Exit and entry of thermal power plants. To reduce SO2 emissions, the 2005 policy also required TCZ cities to shut down small thermal power plants and contain the new establishment of thermal power plants. To check the enforcement of these measures, we construct the entry and exit of thermal power plants at the city level using the same plant-level data mentioned above. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, columns 2 and 3. Our estimates show that the 2005 policy caused more exits and fewer entries of thermal power plants, conﬁrming that the measures were in eﬀect. Given that thermal power plants were the major source of electricity generation in China, these data may imply a slowdown in the economic development. Controlling the growth of dirty sectors.31 Another important measure is to contain 28The plant-level data also help address the issue of gaming brought up in previous literature. Under the target-based system, ﬁrms or individuals would be incentivized to manipulate data and reporting to achieve the pre-set goal (Bevan and Hood, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Gao, 2015). Plant-level data serve as a crosscheck for city-level SO2 emission levels and provide further support for our main results. 29The plant level data can allow us to investigate the heterogeneity of responses across ﬁrms. In particular, one potential future work is to collect data on connections between local oﬃcials and ﬁrms, and examine how the burdens of regulation diﬀer across connected and disconnected ﬁrms. We thank a reviewer for this suggestion. 30The authors identify locations for all thermal power plants mentioned in the Compilation by manually searching for their physical addresses. We then match the plant-level desulfurization progress data released by the Ministry of Environment Protection to our sample. Plant entry and exit data were obtained from the list released annually by the National Development and Reform Commission. 31See footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors. 19', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

To check the implementation of this measure, we collect data from the Annual Surveys of Manufacturing Firms from 2000 to 2008, which are the most comprehensive ﬁrm data in China (including all state-owned enterprises, and non-state- owned enterprise with annual sales above about US$ 74,000). Speciﬁcally, we compare the ﬁrm entry and exit pattern in the dirty sectors between TCZ and non-TCZ cities during this sample period. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, columns 4 and 5. We ﬁnd a negative but not statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient of ﬁrm entry, and a positive and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient of ﬁrm exit. These results imply that after the 2005 policy, there were more ﬁrm exits in the dirty sectors in the TCZ cities compared with the non-TCZ ones, though the two groups of cities had very similar ﬁrm entry patterns in the dirty sectors. Improving the SO2 removal rate. One policy measure requested the improvement of the SO2 removal rate, especially in the dirty sectors. SO2 removal rates are the percentage of total amount of SO2 emissions reduced by various desulfurization technologies. To examine this measure, we calculate the city-level SO2 removal rate as the ratio of the total amount of city SO2 removals over the sum of city SO2 removed and city SO2 emissions. Data were collected from the China City Statistical Yearbooks 2004-2016. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, column 6. We ﬁnd a positive and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient, suggesting the improving SO2 removal rate in the TCZ cities after the 2005 policy. Restructuring of the energy composition. To reduce SO2 emissions, the 2005 policy also suggested an improvement in the energy structure, that is, a shift toward clean energies (such as hydropower, wind power, and nuclear power). To examine the policy eﬀect on the energy structure, we construct a city-level share of clean energies, that is, the share of electricity-generating capacity from hydropower, wind power, and nuclear power over the total capacity. Data for the share of clean energy were collected from the Compilation of Statistical Materials of Electric Power Industry 2001-2010. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, column 7. The estimated coeﬃcient is small and not statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting no shift toward clean energies after the 2005 policy. In sum, our analyses show that most of the measures for reducing SO2 emissions in the 2005 policy were enforced by local bureaucrats, which explains the signiﬁcant drop in SO2 emissions in TCZ cities after 2005 compared with non-TCZ cities. Meanwhile, some of these measures (such as the closure and establishment restriction of thermal power plants, controlling of growth in dirty sectors, etc.) had negative implications for economic development. 20', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 5.2. Revealed preference by local bureaucrats As the second mechanism analysis, we investigate how local bureaucrats revealed their eﬀorts for pollution reduction and economic growth. To this end, we conduct a thorough content analysis of each city government’s Annual Work of the Government Report from 2001 to 2015. The report is usually presented by the city mayor at the city- level National People’s Congress early in the year. The report sets the goals and objectives for city governments’ work for the upcoming year and is meant to be supervised by local residents. Each report outlines the target GDP growth rate for the year, as well as other policy objectives for the city government. As the reports are not available in any existing database or statistical yearbooks, we collected information by manually searching 4288 reports via the China Statistical Yearbooks at city level, city governments’ websites and local newspapers. For pollution reduction, we search for the keywords “environmental protection” (huan bao or huanjing baohu in Chinese) and “emissions reduction” (jian pai in Chinese), and calculate the ratio of the number of these mentions to be the total number of words in the report. We then examine whether the government reports in TCZ cities had more coverage of environmental protection than in non-TCZ cities after 2005. Regression results are reported in Table 7, column 1. We ﬁnd that TCZc ∗ Post05t is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting that TCZ city governments became more concerned about environmental protection after 2005 than non-TCZ city governments. [Insert Table 7 here] In the report, the governments also report their target GDP growth rate in the coming year, which allows us to capture each city government’s emphasis on economic growth. To this end, we estimate our baseline speciﬁcation using the target GDP growth rate as the outcome. Estimation results are reported in Table 7, column 2. We ﬁnd that after 2005, TCZ cities had lower target GDP growth rates than non-TCZ ones. Combined, these results suggest that local bureaucrats in TCZ cities were willing to trade oﬀ GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal. 5.3. Signaling eﬀect While we focus on the career concerns explanation of our ﬁndings, another poten- tial channel for the policy to operate is to send stronger information signals to local bureaucrats about the preferences of the central government and the Communist Party. Speciﬁcally, the veto power of emissions quota in the 2005 policy could strongly suggest the determination of the central government to combat the increasing SO2 emissions. Thus, our ﬁndings of SO2 reductions after the 2005 policy could be an improvement in the information received by local bureaucrats, instead of the motivation of career con- cerns. 21', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT To examine whether our ﬁndings reﬂect the signaling argument, we show that there is a clustering of cities at the target SO2 reduction level. To this end, we use our manually collected city SO2 emissions quota by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (i.e., 2010), which allows us to construct the diﬀerence between the realized and target SO2 reductions for 158 out of the 286 cities in our sample.32 We plot the kernel density distributions of the diﬀerences for TCZ and non-TCZ cities in Fig. 4. We ﬁnd a clear clustering at the point 0, suggesting that local bureaucrats managed to just complete the pollution reduction requirement. Meanwhile, for TCZ cities, there is a much sharper concentration of SO2 reductions just at the target level. These results further suggest the relevance of the career concerns argument for our ﬁndings. [Insert Figure 4 here] 6. Welfare analyses In this section, we present a welfare analysis of the 2005 policy. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst focus on the trade-oﬀs between SO2 emissions reductions and GDP growth, and then compute the health damage and value of statistical lives saved due to the policy. 6.1. Trade-oﬀs between SO2 emissions reductions and GDP growth As shown in Table 3, columns 3 and 4, the 2005 policy led to an average reduction in SO2 emissions by 5564 tonnes at the city level, and a slowdown in the GDP growth rate by 0.846 percentage point. The average city-level GDP in our sample period between 2001 and 2015 is 126.9 × 109 in Chinese Yuan (CNY).33 Due to the spatial diﬀerence in prices, we follow Brandt and Holz (2006) and adjust all GDP values using a provincial price deﬂator with the price of Beijing in 1999 as the baseline. Therefore, a 0.846 percentage point reduction in GDP growth means a loss of 1.07 billion CNY in output (126.9×109 × 0.846% = 1.07 × 109). In other words, one tonne of reduction in industrial SO2 emissions would cost 192,950 CNY (1.07 × 109/5564 = 192, 950). Our estimate shows that local bureaucrats made a decision to forgo a large GDP in exchange for a fast and sizable reduction in SO2 emissions. Welfare beneﬁts of emissions reductions, such as mortality and health consequences, are usually computed based on pollutant concentration (µg/m3) in the literature. To be consistent with existing literature, we also compute the marginal cost per µg/m3 reduction in SO2 concentration. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst convert SO2 emissions reductions 32Note that the sample size we use in this analysis is smaller than that in Table 2. This is because in constructing Table 1, we need to know only whether a city has achieved its targeted reduction or not. For the analysis presented here, we need to know the target and actual reductions in numbers. 33Authors’ own calculation using data from all 286 cities in our sample.

Appendix A outlines the detailed method we use to do the conversion. Using the method, a reduction of 5564 tonnes in SO2 emissions weight is equivalent to a reduction of 4.1 µg/m3 in SO2 air concentration at city level. Therefore, based on our estimates in Table 3, every 1 µg/m3 reduction in SO2 concentration would cost 261 million CNY (1.07 × 109/(4.1µg/m3) = 261 × 106). In the next section, we use the converted reduction in SO2 air concentration to com- pute value of statistical lives saved by the policy. 6.2. Health damage and value of statistical lives As an alternative method for welfare analysis, we deviate from the SO2-GDP trade-oﬀ, and calculate health damage of pollution to evaluate our estimated eﬀect of the policy. According to World Bank (1997), there is no direct mortality risk associated with SO2 exposure. The report also suggests that the disease incidences associated with per million per µg/m3 increase in SO2 concentration for chest discomfort and respiratory symptoms (child) are 10,000 cases and 5 cases per million people, respectively. Using the valuation given in Ho and Jorgenson (2003), the cost per case is 9.8 in 1997 CNY.34 According to the government documentation, TCZ cities cover about 39% of population in China.35 Assume that China has a population of 1.4 billion, and the 2005 policy reduced the SO2 air concentration by 4.1 µg/m3, the estimated policy eﬀect on reduction in disease incidences for TCZ cities therefore has a monetary value of 219.5 million (1997 CNY) (4.1× 39% × 1400× (10,000× 9.8 +5× 9.8) = 219.5 million). Note that the cost of SO2 reduction (in terms of GDP) presented in the previous section is at the city level, while the social beneﬁt of disease incidences reduction is at the national level. To make the numbers comparable, we need to multiply the cost of SO2 reduction at city level by the number of TCZ cities in our sample (i.e. 1.07 × 162 =173 billion). While there is no direct mortality risk of SO2 as suggested by the World Bank report, there would be secondary mortality risks if SO2 is converted to PM2.5. Our analysis indicates that the 2005 policy reduced PM2.5 concentration by 1.5% (Table 4, Column 4). Based on Chen et al. (2017), the national average mortality risk associated with every 10 µg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 is about 17.55 thousand lives. The average PM2.5 level in our sample city is 31.66 µg/m3.36 Therefore, a 1.5% reduction in PM2.5 concentration would lead to 833 (31.66 × 1.5% × 17550/10 = 833) lives saved. Based on World Bank’s valuation, the estimated value of a statistical life is about 585,000 in 1997 CNY.37 Thus, 34In later updates made by Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the authors adjust the valuation per case to be 6.2 (low scenario) and 10 (high scenario), both in 1997 CNY. 35The relevant Chinese document for the TCZ policy is available at the following government website: http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/wj/200910/t20091022_172231.htm 36See Table 2. 37The estimated value of statistical life in the literature ranges from 230,000 - 1.2 million in 1997 CNY. 23', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT the total value of statistical lives saved due to the 2005 policy is about 487.3 million in 1997 CNY (833 × 585,000 = 487.3 ×106). In summary, our welfare analysis suggests that the cost of the program far exceeds its beneﬁt. As the program is able to achieve the targeted emissions cut in a very short period of time, our calculation suggests that the Chinese government is willing to pay a premium for immediate and sizable pollution reductions. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we examine the eﬀect of a target-based performance evaluation system on SO2 emissions reductions. We ﬁnd that when SO2 emissions quotas were built into the evaluation system for local bureaucrats, SO2 emissions were signiﬁcantly reduced. In the meantime, real GDP growth rates also decreased signiﬁcantly. Our analysis suggests that the new evaluation system induced local bureaucrats to exert more eﬀort on environ- mental issues related to SO2 emissions. We ﬁnd no spillover eﬀects of the policy on other non-targeted pollutants such as CO2 or wastewater. Using a comprehensive dataset that we constructed, we observe that after the new administrative system was in place, local bureaucrats are more likely to implement policies that speciﬁcally targeted SO2 emissions reduction, such as shutting down power plants and installing desulfurization technologies. Implementation of these policies indicates that local bureaucrats are exerting more eﬀort on achieving the target set for decreasing emissions by the central government. Our ﬁnding adds to the empirical debate on the eﬀectiveness of target-based perfor- mance evaluation systems for public sector workers, particularly for management-level bureaucrats. As the earlier literature has highlighted, the addition of a concrete perfor- mance target into an evaluation system might aﬀect the overall comprehensive output as bureaucrats will divert their attention to the output that is more heavily weighted by their supervisors. Our analysis shows a clear pattern that the local bureaucrats made a conscious trade-oﬀ between growth and SO2 emissions when emissions targets are brought into the picture. Our results indicate that setting a concrete target-based performance evaluation sys- tem for environmental policies can be eﬀective in ensuring that bureaucrats work to curb pollution and promote environmental protection. The eﬀect is immediate, and the impact is signiﬁcant. Developing countries facing similar pressing environmental issues might want to consider the implementation of such a policy.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Appendix A We use a method proposed by Ho and Jorgenson (2003) to convert reductions in emissions in weight to reductions in the SO2 ambient air concentration. Speciﬁcally, total SO2 emissions at height c can be expressed as Ec = Σj∈cEj (3) where c = low, medium and high. High-emissions industries include all types of electricity power sectors. Medium-emissions industries include coal mining, natural gas and metal ming sectors etc. Low-emissions industries include agriculture and all tertiary sectors. 38 To convert the total emissions Ec into the air concentration, we follow the linear reduced form suggested by Ho and Jorgenson (2002) and Garbaccio et al. (2000) 39 : C = γlowElow + γmediumEmedium + γhighEhigh where γlow, γmedium and γhigh are conversion coeﬃcient computed by the authors based on Lvovsky and Hughes (1997). For urban SO2 emissions, γlow = 0.03364, γmedium = 0.00607 and γhigh = 0.00096. These coeﬃcients are computed for 11 Chinese cities us- ing a emission-concentration dispersion model. Ho and Jorgenson (2003) reweigh these coeﬃcients to arrive at the conversion coeﬃcient γ for all urban China. We use a sim- ilar strategy in Ho and Jorgenson (2003) and reweigh their coeﬃcients proportionately so that it matches the average SO2 concentration level in our sample period. We then compute the reduction of the SO2 concentration as a result of the 2005 policy change. Our method can be outlined in the following steps: Step 1: Recalibrate the conversion coeﬃcients γlow, γmedium and γhigh. The origi- nal conversion coeﬃcients computed by Lvovsky and Hughes (1997) are γlow = 0.03364, γmedium = 0.00607 and γhigh = 0.00096, but the coeﬃcients capture only the 11 Chinese cities in their sample. In order to compute a national conversion coeﬃcient, we need to calibrate these numbers so that they match the national average SO2 concentration in our sample period. There are no SO2 air concentration values for cities in our dataset; there- fore we resort to other resources. The Ambient Air Quality Standard in China classiﬁes cities with average SO2 concentration below 60 µg/m3 as healthy and below 10 µg/m3 as good. According to the annual report published by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in China, in our sample period more than 80% of cities has an average SO2 38Please see Ho and Jorgenson (2003) for a complete list of industry emissions height classiﬁcations. 39In Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the authors discuss the diﬀerence between the emissions height method and a method based on intake fractions. We are not able to implement the intake fractions method as we do not know the exact breakdown of the emissions industries (we know only the broad categories as indicated in Table 1). Thus, for our purpose, the method presented in this section is the most feasible. 25', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT concentrations between 10 µg/m3 and 60 µg/m3.40 When the initial TCZ policy was designed in 1998, all cities with annual SO2 concentrations higher than 60 µg/m3 were classiﬁed as TCZ cities. Therefore, we would calibrate the coeﬃcients against 60 µg/m3 for our analysis. The average city- level annual industrial emissions in our control sam- ple is 38110 tonnes. According to the China Pollution Source Census 2007, industrial emissions usually consist of 91.4% of the total emissions, while the remaining 8.6% is non- industrial emissions. Therefore, we assume the average total emissions are 38110/0.914 = 41696 tonnes (38110 industrial emissions and 3586 non-industrial emissions). Following Ho and Jorgenson (2003), we assume the coeﬃcients are being re-scaled proportionately. Let ϕ be the scaling factor. Then the following conditions have to be satisﬁed: 60µg/m3 = 0.03364ϕElow + 0.00607ϕEmedium + 0.00096ϕEhigh Elow + Emedium + Ehigh = 41696 (4) To determine emissions at diﬀerent heights, i.e., Elow, Emedium and Ehigh, we ﬁrst match the emitting industries in Table 1 to the emission height class data in Ho and Jorgenson (2003). Among the industrial sectors mentioned in Table 1, the production and supply of electricity power and heat is considered high while everything else is in the medium cate- gory. Note that Table 1 covers only 88.5% of all industrial SO2 emissions. For simplicity, we assume the missing 12.5% industrial emissions are proportionately distributed between the high and medium categories. In other words, out of the total 38110 tonnes industrial emissions, 56.95% (50.4%/88.5%) would be in the high emissions category, and the rest (43.05%) would be in the medium category. Therefore, Ehigh = 38110 × 56.95% = 21704 tonne and Emedium = 38110 × 43.05% = 16406 tonnes. Non-industrial emissions come from either the agriculture sector or households; both are classiﬁed as the low emissions category. Therefore, Elow = 3586 tonnes. Substitute the emissions number Elow,Emedium and Ehigh back in equation 4, and we get ϕ = 0.25. After calibration, the conversion coeﬃcients, therefore, are γlow = 0.00841, γmedium = 0.00152 and γhigh = 0.00024. Step 2: In this step, we compute the reduction in the SO2 concentration. We have computed that the policy reduces total industrial emissions by 5564 tonnes. We assume the reductions are distributed proportionately across sectors in Table 1 and the policy has no impact on non-industrial sectors. Thus, 56.95% of the emissions reductions happens in the high emissions category while 43.05% happens in the low emissions category. This means after reduction Ehigh = 21704 − 5, 564 × 56.95% = 18535 tonnes and Emedium = 16406−5564×43.05% = 14011 tonnes.

       " Document(page_content='RESEARCH ARTICLE The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China Gen-Fu Feng1 & Minyi Dong1 & Jun Wen1 & Chun-Ping Chang2 Received: 17 April 2018 /Accepted: 4 June 2018 # Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2018 Abstract Political incentive is one of the most efficient methods to promote local officials to push for both economic growth and environmental progress in the context of China. Since previous scholars have never investigated the relationships between political turnover and environmental governance at the municipal level, in this work, we proxy pollution by SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx and examine whether environmental performance affects the political turnover of the municipal party secretary by exploiting a panel conditional logit with a fixed-effect model for the period 2002–2013. The results indicate that environ- mental performance does not significantly impact the turnover of municipal party secretaries, offering evidence that an increase of SO2 is associated with the likelihood of promotion under the panel multinomial logit approach. However, a higher GDP growth rate plays the determinant factor affecting the promotion of China’s municipal party secretaries. Specific policy recom- mendations are proposed in accordance with our empirical findings. Keywords Environmental performance . Political turnover . Municipal party secretary . China . GDP growth rate JEL classification Q56 . Q58 . P18 Introduction After China initiated its policy reforms and opened up its country to international markets, the central government turned to economic construction and highlighted the principle of Bdevelopment is the only way,^ generating the demand for stable economic growth. Over the last few decades, China has created its own distinct Beconomic miracle^ through bright economic performances, and this phenomenon has attracted the interests of many scholars. Some studies attribute this mir- acle to the incentive mechanism of economic growth under the situation of China’s special political system. For instance, Blanchard and Shleifer (2001) emphasize the importance of political incentive or career concern to explain the great eco- nomic contribution of Chinese local officials. They indicate that China’s central government responds swiftly to reward or punish local officials according to their local economic performances and thus promote the local economy, implying complementary relationships between economic growth and political promotion of local officials. Easterly (2005) notes that the growth generation needs the Bright incentives,^ be- cause people do respond to incentives, and any factors that impact the incentive mechanism will eventually influence economic growth. Political promotions have indeed been regarded as one of the most important career objectives of government officials. In gen- eral, most previous scholars have pointed out that political turn- over of government officials is usually linked with their econom- ic performances. For example, Li and Zhou (2005) investigate that the likelihood of provincial leaders’ promotion is positively influenced by their economic performance, but there is the Responsible editor: Nicholas Apergis * Chun-Ping Chang cpchang@g2.usc.edu.tw Gen-Fu Feng fgf@mail.xjtu.edu.cn Minyi Dong dondmy-123@163.com Jun Wen wjun1978@163.com 1 School of Economics and Finance, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, Shaanxi, China 2 Shih Chien University at Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung 845, Taiwan Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2499-8', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='likelihood of termination when economic performance turns down. Additionally, Zang (2001) states that the promotion of officials is determined by the performance of governance, which is commonly composed of economic, social, and political per- formances. There are also more similar arguments proposed by Chen et al. (2005), Easterly (2005), Xu et al. (2007), Xu and Wang (2010), Feng and Wu (2013), as well as Wu and Chen (2016). However, along with the notion of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), economic growth commonly accom- panies environmental degradation (Ang 2007; Jalil and Mahmud 2009; Soytas and Sari 2009; Acaravci and Oztark 2010; Apergis and Payne 2010; Lean and Smyth 2010). For example, Gozgor et al. (2018) observe that both the renewable and non-renewable energy consumption significantly and positively influence the economic growth; Cai and Guo (2009) construct a dynamic model and demonstrate a positively linear relationship between GDP per capita and pollutant emissions when holding green technical progress and environmental invest- ment constant. While this indicates that rapid economic growth likely affects the sustainable development of the environment, most studies up to now simply focus on interactions between the political turnover of officials and their economic perfor- mance, with most of them ignoring the linkages among politi- cians’ turnover and environmental governance. During the period of China’s miraculous growth, local of- ficials have taken up active roles in several aspects, such as promoting reform of the economic system, strengthening re- gional economic cooperation, building infrastructure, devel- oping the private economy, and attracting investment. Therefore, the key issue for the incentive mechanism of China’s economic growth is the efficiency incentives offered to local officials. Qian and Roland (1998) point out that both the reform of decentralization and the fiscal responsibility system are crucial sources of incentives for local governments. However, Zhou (2007) holds a different view, putting forward that simple decentralization in an administra- tion and finance cannot be deemed as an efficient incentive mechanism for local officials; political promotion incentives should be deemed as an important factor to analyze how local governments push economic development. In a similar vein, some scholars indicate that fiscal revenue is very important for local officials, but they are more concerned about opportuni- ties of promotion during their political career; thus, promotion incentives make up the most direct incentive mechanism for local officials versus decentralization in administration and finance (Blanchard and Shleifer 2001; Maskin et al. 2000). Moreover, Xu et al. (2010) investigate that local officials tend to enact policies that are conducive to local economic growth, in response to political incentives. In this context, the criteria for promotion of local govern- ment officials attach great importance to regional economic performance as well (Chen and Lu 2010). Previous studies also note that the turnover of Chinese officials is mostly influenced by their economic performances. Whiting (2001) demonstrates that, in the early stages, Chinese cadres are eval- uated according to their economic performances by listing a lot of anecdotal evidence. Moreover, traditional works have also identified that greater economic performances enhance the likelihood of local leaders’ political promotion, and their likelihood of being terminated increases when local economic performances decrease.1 Zhang (2005) states that the reform of the cadre and personnel system has created an efficient incentive mechanism for political promotion of local govern- ment officials. Furthermore, a measurable view of achieve- ment has been developed along with decentralization of au- thority and tax-sharing in the financial system. Zhou (2004) similarly proposes the concept of Bpolitical tournaments,^ which refer to political promotion games among the same level of local officials, whether at the provincial level or municipal level.2 He points out that those local officials not only compete with each other for political promotion but also for regional GDP growth and taxation in the economic sphere (Tong and Song 2012). In this way, Xu (2011) indicates that political promotions of government officials in China’s regional areas (such as provinces, municipalities, counties, and town- ships), are closely related to their economic performances. Moreover, Maskin et al. (2000) state that the political status of a Chinese province is closely related to its provincial economic ranking, implying that regional government officials have mo- tivations to improve economic performance for the sake of their area’s performance rankings as well. While focusing on provincial investigations, Chen et al. (2005) analyze the relationship between performance valuation and the turnover of provincial leaders, proving that the promotion of provincial leaders hinges on provincial economic performances. Similarly, Feng and Wu (2013) in- vestigate the roles of economic factor, non-economic factor, and personal characteristics in the promotion evaluation mechanism at the provincial level over the period 1978– 2008. Their empirical results find that economic growth per- formance leads to a greater impact on the promotion probabil- ity of lower-ranking officials, while non-economic factors are more important for higher-level officials. He et al. (2014) states that the higher the complete proportion is of the eco- nomic growth target, the greater the probability for political promotion, whereas promotion is the case for the circum- stance of high economic growth targets.3 Alternatively, Earle and Gehlbach (2015) demonstrate that political turnover in the 1 The terminated cases include officials who are replaced, retired, or moving to the same level. 2 Qian and Xu (1993) similarly prove the existence of Bpolitical tournaments.^ Their research investigates that the multidivisional-form structure allows local officials to compete with each other for opportunities of promotion through yardstick competition. 3 However, when the local economic growth target is low, there is no signif- icant relationship between complete proportion and probability of political promotion.

       " Document(page_content='context of weak institutions presents substantial distributional effects that are reflected in economic productivity, using the case investigation of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. As an emerging economy, China has maintained an overall fast economic growth over the past several decades, though a certain degree of environmental degradation has accompanied this steadfast growth. The existing incentive mechanism, whose core indicator is local economic performance, has led local gov- ernments to develop their economy regardless of any negative externalities, such as redundant construction and transboundary pollution. Many scholars attach great importance to this issue today, with most having recognized the truth that when economic growth is realized, the policy-making behaviors of local officials simultaneously produce enormous negative impacts on local en- ergy efficiency. Under the incentives of fiscal revenue and op- portunities of promotion, for the sake of attracting foreign capital, local governments compete to lower the threshold of environ- mental conservation. Furthermore, in order to promote local eco- nomic growth and attract investment, local governments may enact preferential policies of land and credit to enterprises and keep down prices of factors of production, thus leading enter- prises to adopt original technology instead of clean technology (Shen and Fu 2006). Cheng and Tsai (2009) investigate heavily polluting coal-fired power plants in Inner Mongolia. Their results show that, in order to enhance economic growth, the government permits those enterprises to construct illegal power plants, which is a this conclusion that agrees with the view of Zhou (2009) in his study. The problem of environmental pollution is widespread in China after several decades of strong growth. The central gov- ernment frequently uses this issue to foster blame on officials and have them take responsibility for such environmental de- terioration. For example, members of the National People’s Congress assert in the Eleventh National Committee of the People’s Political Consultative Conference in 2010 that ac- cording to the political incentives, environmental governance has to be considered in the promotion mechanism of politi- cians.4 The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) acts as the headquarters of the nation’s political system, which has the absolute power to transfer government officials within different layers of state administrations (Bo 2004; Li 2006). In the past, based on the goal of economic construction, the valuation mechanism of local officials’ po- litical promotion was designed on the basis of local economic growth, with environmental governance rarely being taken into consideration. A few papers have discussed the relationship between envi- ronmental governance and political promotion of local officials. For instance, Ran (2013) indicates that there lacks a substantial relationship between environmental governance performance and political promotion of local officials, since most existing environmental performance appraisals are mere formalities and lose their function of political incentive. Wu et al. (2013) state that environmental governance produces a negative impact on political promotion. According to their empirical results, for a one standard deviation increase in investment of environmental improvement (adjusted by average GDP), the likelihood of po- litical promotion for a mayor and secretary, respectively, de- creases by 6.3 and 8.5 percentage points, holding other factors constant. Based on water pollution data of 499 stations located along China’s seven major rivers from 2004 to 2010, Kahn et al. (2015) document evidence that chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measurement of general health of a river, significantly decreased since Chinese central government proclaimed to tie officials’ promotion chances to COD in 2006. Michallet et al. (2015) investigate the process of how political parties adjust the platform towards environmentalism and demonstrate that envi- ronmental concern of political parties is significantly correlated with the country-level economic conditions and their political ideology. Gao and Lei (2016) trace the changes of pollution and energy consumption and their impacts on officials’ promotion, their findings show that energy conservation does not have significant influence on official promotions. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012 has taken a momentous decision to emphatically promote the construction of an eco- logical civilization, which means resource consumption, envi- ronmental degradation, and ecological benefit should be includ- ed in the evaluation systems of economic and social develop- ment (Jia 2012). Owing to the appraisal mechanism of political promotion for local officials, which gives priority to local GDP as the standard performance evaluation, competitions among local governments have led to a distortion of local public policy. Thus, environmental conservation, with its obvious externality characteristics, inevitably has become one type of sacrificial public function. Some local governments neglect environmen- tal issues and even sacrifice the environment in exchange for temporary economic growth (Wang and Di 2002; Lv 2014), with the resulting intensification of social conflict now more common in society (Yang et al. 2008). The aforesaid literature shows that most studies investigate the issue of political turnover on the basis of provincial data. Up to the present, scholars have never looked at the municipal level in China to discuss the relationship between political turnover and its possible influence factors, such as environ- mental issues. Therefore, we focus on the municipal level and further explore the relationship between environmental perfor- mance and political turnover of the municipal party secretary.5 This study first adopts the panel conditional logit model with fixed effects to analyze possible influence factors in the pro- motion mechanism of China’s municipal party secretaries, 4 See the details in Jia (2012). 5 The municipal party secretary is the most influential official in a local gov- ernment (Li and Zhou. 2005).

For the sake of the rigor of estimation, we also introduce several demographic variables for whether the leaders ever joined the Chinese Communist Youth League, engaged in jobs related to the communist party, their age, educational level, tenure of party secretary, and population of the cities. Our empirical results show no linkages between municipal environmental performance and political promo- tion of local officials, but economic performance does impact the promotion of municipal officials. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The section BMethodology^ introduces the econometric methodology adopted. The section BEmpirical analysis^ displays the data source, variable descriptions, and detailed empirical analysis. The section BConclusion and implications^ summarizes the conclusion and offers possible political implications. Methodology The panel conditional logit fixed-effect model As introduced beforehand, the dependent variable of this study is whether a municipal party secretary was promoted in a particular year in a specific city, which means the depen- dent variable is a binary choice variable. Thus, we employ the conditional panel logit fixed-effect model for the estimate. Our model takes the assumption below: yit ¼ 1 if y* yit ¼ 0 if y*it > 0 it ≤0 ð1Þ Here, y* it ¼ μi þ X 0 itβ þ εit. This function can be interpreted as a municipal party secretary being promoted de- pends on observed variables (X), unobserved individual (city) characteristics (μ), and a random error term (ε). The probabil- ity for the promotion of a municipal party secretary that we observe is as follows: P yit ¼ 1 ð Þ ¼ P y* �it > 0 � ¼ P εit > −μi−x 0 itβ � � ¼ F μi þ x 0 itβ � � ð2Þ In order to overcome the problem of incidental parameters, owing to the number of parameters increasing with the num- ber of cities in a fixed-effect model, Chamberlain (1980) pro- poses a conditional logit estimation to condition the likelihood function on a minimal sufficient statistic for the fixed effects, which can be written as follows: L ¼ ΠN i¼1P yi1; ⋯; yiT ∑T ��i¼tyit � � ð3Þ The probability of the observed promotion of a municipal party secretary no longer depends on the fixed effects. Therefore, the coefficients of our variables of interest can be estimated consistently under the conditional logit estimator.6 Promotionit ¼ α þ β1Pollutionit−1 þ β2X it−1 þ ηi þ ϵit ð4Þ Here, Promotion is assigned 1 when the municipal party secretary has moved up from the previous position in that particular year or otherwise, 0; Pollution is the proxy for the environmental pollution variables, including SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx; X is a vector of variables testing our hypoth- eses; ηi indicates city-specific dummies; and εit is an i.i.d. disturbance term, whereby all idiosyncratic factors are cap- tured by the error term. To avoid the problem of simultaneity, all explanatory economic variables are lagged by 1 year in the estimation model. The panel multinomial logit regression model The multinomial logit regression is the most suitable model in a discrete choice analysis, in which a choice set exists that contains more than two alternatives (So and Kuhfeld 1995). This model implies that the decision between two different alternative sets is independent from the presence of more al- ternatives, and this is one of the most important assumptions of the multinomial logit model. Furthermore, it provides use- ful information when determining the correct type of model to estimate multinomial logit equations (Berdiev et al. 2012). For example, Wei et al. (2005) employ a multinomial logit model to investigate the entry modes of foreign direct investment in China, while Levy Yeyati et al. (2010) utilize a multinomial logit approach to test the endogeneity of exchange rate regimes. Let us imagine that there are several situations concerning the political turnover for the municipal party secretary. Hence, for a deeper investigation, the dependent variable is catego- rized as: 1, when the municipal party secretary is replaced; 2, when one’s political career terminates (retirement); 3, when one stays at the same level; and 4, when the party secretary is promoted. In order to fit into the nature of the dependent variable, we employ the panel multinomial logit approach with the fixed- effect model for further investigations. The probability that the 6 The variables that hardly vary over time thus should be excluded in the model (Mierau et al. 2007).

The long sample period helps to trace the performance of local political turnover since major pollutant emissions are embodied in officials’ appraisal mechanism, and it covers several vital time points in terms of environmental governance, for example, indicator COD was embodied into the per- formance appraisal system of officials’ promotion in 2006 (Kahn et al. 2015); according to BControl Program of Total Emission of National Major Pollutants during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period^ promulgated by the State Council in 2006, the specific emission control to- wards SO2 and COD are implemented during the period 2006–2010; and China’s central government started to tie promotion opportunities of politicians to the local envi- ronmental quality in 2010 (Jia 2012). Most of the data are obtained from the China City Statistics Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbooks, and China Environmental Statistical database; and the personal ties and credentials of munic- ipal party secretaries come from the China Leading Cadre Database. Table 8 lists the detailed descriptions of vari- ables and data sources. The dependent variable: the classifications of political turnover The dependent variable is the turnover mode of the municipal party secretary. Here, two-way classification is selected in a panel conditional logit model (1 = promotion; 0 = otherwise). To ensure robustness of the empirical results, we use a four- way classification to measure the political turnover in a panel multinomial logit regression (1 = replaced; 2 = retirement; 3 = stays at the same level; and 4 = promotion). Explanatory variables The choice of explanatory variables is governed by the avail- ability of data as well as theoretical issues, and the explanatory variables used herein are introduced below. The first category for explanatory variables is a set of pollution variables, which refer to SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx, respectively. Among them, SO2 is the overall concentration of sulfur dioxide in each city and reflects sulfur dioxide emissions caused by local enterprises during the process of production and fuel combus- tion. The variable COD is an important indicator for control- ling water pollution, and this index is applied to measure the concentration of reducing substances in industrial wastewater. A greater value of COD signifies a high concentration of re- ducing substances in wastewater; furthermore, the major in- gredient for reducing substances is organic contaminant. SOOT refers to the overall concentration of industrial soot and dust, which is caused by fuel combustion of local enter- prises in each city. Finally, NHx is the overall concentration of nitrogen oxides in each city and reflects nitrogen oxide emis- sions caused by local enterprises during the process of pro- duction and fuel combustion. These four explanatory vari- ables serve as measurements of per capita pollution level (di- vided by 10,000 people); the lower the value is for these var- iables, the greater the level will be for local environmental governance. As mentioned in most related research (Li and Zhou 2005; Feng and Wu 2013), a local area’s economic performance is one of the most crucial factors that may influence political turnover (Zhou 2004). We thus follow the previous literature and employ the growth rate of real GDP per capita (GDP, constant in year 2000 and transformed into natural logarithm) to assess the level of economic performance in various cities. We further incorporate additional explanatory variables to measure the professional experience of municipal party secre- taries for efficient estimation. Following Li and Zhou (2005) as well as Opper and Brehm (2007), we consider whether or not the municipal party secretary is a member of the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) to capture potential net- work ties. Hu (2012) investigates the promotion path of 22 municipal mayors and party secretaries in China and finds that 15 out of 22 are members of CCYL. He points out that Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='although CCYL is a mass-based organization, it has the char- acteristics of being quasi-government and is like an adminis- tration; thus, senior members of CCYL usually have greater probability to serve in a local government as party officials after a job transfer.7 CCYL is 1 if the party secretary is a member of CCYL, or otherwise 0. During the 17th CPC National Congress, the Party Central Committee put forward that the promotion mechanism of gov- ernment officials should attach importance to the richness of their political experience. Government officials, who have abundant political qualifications in central ministries and com- missions, large SOEs, and provincial and municipal govern- ments, tend to have a greater probability to be reappointed or promoted. The variable Experience measures whether a mu- nicipal party secretary has ever engaged in a job (such Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General, and Director of the Office) related to the party and government work for a professional administration; if yes, 1; otherwise, 0 (Opper and Brehm 2007). We adopt BTenure^ in the estimated model, which describes the time period that the municipal party sec- retary is in office. In China, one completed term for officials is 5 years in general, and reappointment is permitted. Generally speaking, the fourth and fifth years are assumed to be the most crucial period for political promotion since the local officials are normally allowed to make a redeployment only when their term has ended. However, once the municipal party secretary is reappointed to stay in the same level, the likelihood of promotion during the following working life would become extremely low. Thus, we utilize the continuous form of vari- able Tenure and assume that the longer the duration of munic- ipal officials’ tenure, the lower the likelihood of political promotion. According to the BOutline of National Party and Government Leading Group,^ the political leading groups of local governments should maintain the main body of officials to be around 55 years old if a political shuffle happens (Wang et al. 2009). This provision is coincident with the principle that Bthe contingent of cadres should become younger in age.^ Therefore, the age of party secretaries (Age) also presents its influence on the probability of promotion; as stated before, the younger the municipal party secretary is, the higher the prob- ability is for political promotion (Li and Zhou 2005). Moreover, the education level of local government officials can also influence their political careers, as highly educated cadres are preferred following the BOutline of National Party and Government Leading Group.^ Ever since China’s re- forms, Byounger in age^ and Bhighly educated^ have become crucial indicators; thus, high educational background is con- ducive to enhance the probability of political promotion for government officials. The variable Education is a dummy variable defined as 1 if the municipal party secretary has a college education, or otherwise 0. Finally, we follow Opper and Brehm (2007) to control for the size of different cities’ total population (Population, transformed in natural loga- rithm). It is likely that a bigger city size will lead to higher promotion chances for municipal leaders. Empirical results Results of the panel conditional logit model Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics. As can be seen, the mean of Promotion is 0.235, indicating that the likelihood of promotion for municipal officials does not seem to be great in China. Among the pollution variables, SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx, although the difference between their maximum and minimum is large, their means are relatively small. The max- imum and minimum of SO2 are respectively 265.74 and 0.058, but its mean is 26.107, which indicates that most ob- served cities possess a lower level of SO2; the means are 12.644, 11.423, and 1.588 for COD, SOOT, and NHx, respectively. The mean of GDP is 9.934, and its standard deviation is 0.977, implying the economic growth of the observed cities differs very little, and most cities maintain relatively high GDP growth. Age ranges from 48 to 77 and has a mean of 60.99, indicating that most party secretaries are in their 50s or 60s. Table 1 shows that the average Tenure of municipal party leaders is about 2.86 years, varying from 1 to 11 years. For the dummy variables CCYL, Education, and Experience, their conditions appear different. The mean value of CCYL is 0.235, which implies that most municipal party secretaries are not members of CCYL. The mean value of Education is 0.941, indicating that almost all party secretaries have re- ceived a college education. Furthermore, the mean of Experience (0.488) shows that almost half of party secretaries have experienced job related to the party or government. Table 2 displays the means of political turnover and envi- ronmental pollution for all 113 cities. We find that those cities with a relatively higher likelihood of party secretaries being replaced, in retirement, staying at the same level, and experiencing promotion are Handan, Qingdao, Changsha, and Handan, respectively. Furthermore, concerning the pollu- tion variables, evidence shows that SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx are relatively higher in Jinchang, Lasa, Shizuishan, and Jinchang, while Haikoy, Chifeng, Shantou, and Taizhou enjoy relatively great environmental performance. In the point of linkage between political turnover and environmental pollu- tion, it can be observed that cities with higher likelihood of political promotion tend to suffer severer environmental 7 One of the most important measurements of the promotion mechanism of party officials is Bthe contingent of cadres should become younger in age^. There is a preferential policy towards senior cadres of CCYL during the pro- cess of cadre cultivation and selection. This causes government officials among the same level of cadres, which have the advantage of age, to mostly be members of CCYL.

       " Document(page_content='pollution in general, while such tendency is typically embod- ied in the interaction between promotion likelihood and SO2 emission. Table 3 displays the results of the impacts of SO2 pollution on the likelihood of municipal party secretary promotions, using the conditional logit model. As can be seen, the statistics of P-Hausman in all equations are 0.00, indicating that the fixed-effect model is appropriate. In all estimations, the de- pendent variable is assigned the value of 1 for a promotion, or 0 otherwise. To begin with, in models (1), (3), and (4), the evidence shows that SO2 is statistically insignificant at the 5% level, implying that the SO2 emissions do not have a signifi- cant impact on the promotion of municipal party secretaries in China, while being a member of CCYL increases the likeli- hood of promotion for municipal party secretaries, except for in model (4). More precisely, models (1) and (2) show that the likelihood of political promotion is 1.284 (namely exp (0.25)) times greater for municipal party secretaries who are members of CCYL, comparing to those who are not. However, GDP appears to be statistically significant at conventional levels in most specifications for models (2)–(4); this implies that a higher GDP growth rate usually is combined with a higher likelihood of promotion for municipal leaders. Taking model (2) as an example, a one standard deviation increase in mu- nicipal GDP growth leads to a 62.528 (0.64*0.977) percent- age point increase in the likelihood of promotion. This result reflects the clear effect of economic performance on the like- lihood of promotion in China. These results are also consistent with those of Chen et al. (2005) and Li and Zhou (2005). Regardless of professional experience and personal ties of party secretaries, in model (2), Experience is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. Surprisingly, in model (3), Experience becomes the most crucial influence factors under such circumstance, that is, the coefficient of Experience is 0.84, implying that the likelihood of promotion is 2.31 (exp (0.84)) times greater for municipal secretaries who have engaged in jobs related to party and government work compared with those who have not. Furthermore, note that the variable Tenure presents strongly negative influence on likelihood of promotion for party secretaries, and a one standard deviation increase in Tenure causes likelihood of promotion to decrease by 124.821 (0.69*1.809) percentage points in model (4). Besides, Age is not statistically significant in both models (2) and (4), implying that age is not a crucial factor during the process of determining turnover mode of municipal party secretary. Finally, both Education and Population are proved to have significant positive impacts on the promotion of party secretary, higher levels of education and bigger size of city increase the likelihood of promotion, these findings are also in line with the Li and Zhou (2005) as well as Opper and Brehm (2007). In a word, based on the above plentiful analysis, it is clear that, in China, the most important factor of political promotion for municipal party secretary is GDP growth but not for the performance of environmental governance in China, this is coincident with the conclusion of Chen et al. (2005). Next, we turn to change the pollution variables as COD, SOOT, and NHx, the results are displayed in Tables 4, 5, and 6. As before, we find that all our pollution variables are statisti- cally insignificant, except for the NHx in model (3) of Table 5, which shows significant negative impacts on the promotion, implying that higher pollutions usually combing with lower probability of officials’ promotion. Similarly, again, greater economic growth expands the promotion of municipal party secretary in all equations, suggesting that higher economic performance lead to a higher probability of implementing a Table 1 Basic descriptive statistical analysis Variable Observations Mean Standard deviation Minimum Maximum Replaced 1353 0.267 0.442 0 1 Same level 1272 0.052 0.222 0 1 Retirement 1351 0.014 0.118 0 1 Promotion 1351 0.235 0.424 0 1 SO2 1326 26.107 28.131 0.058 265.742 COD 1225 12.644 9.636 0.806 172.107 SOOT 1334 11.423 23.075 0.013 710.105 NHx 1333 1.588 1.876 0.114 24.298 GDP 1355 9.934 0.977 0 11.717 CCYL 1337 0.235 0.424 0 1 Experience 1339 0.488 0.500 0 1 Tenure 1353 2.860 1.809 1 11 Age 1352 60.999 5.031 48 77 Education 1335 0.941 0.236 0 1 Population 1350 5.992 0.748 3.37 8.12 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",

Results of the panel multinomial logit regression model We now seek to discover further support for the robustness of our results via the panel multinomial logit approach with a fixed-effect model, where the municipal party secretaries may face a four-way classification about their turnover: 1, if replaced; 2, if into retirement; 3, if at the same level; and 4, if promoted. Hence, the parameters in Table 7 demonstrate the impact of the independent variables on the choice of promo- tion under consideration relative to the baseline category of replaced, retirement, and same level. Table 7 presents the results of estimation. It can be seen that models (1), (2), and (3) only consider the influence of eco- nomic performance on the promotion of municipal party sec- retaries, while models (4), (5), and (6) take the impacts of environmental governance into consideration.

       " Document(page_content='coefficient in the equations, suggesting that a bright economic performance more likely contributes to the promotion of a municipal party secretary relative to those different baseline categories. Again, we provide evidence that economic growth plays a critical role concerning the promotion of municipal partisan leaders. However, when models (4), (5), and (6) in Table 7 include pollution variables, it can be seen that an increase of SO2 is associated with the enhancement of the likelihood of promotion under consideration relative to those being replaced, under retirement, and at the same level. This does not match our anticipation but does imply that higher SO2 emissions are conducive to the promotion of a municipal party secretary, which is similar to the conclusion of Wu et al. (2013). Comparing to COD, SOOT, and NHx, SO2 is the pri- mary source of China’s industrial pollutants, specifically, China’s industrial SO2 emission reached 24.68 million ton and accounted for 86.7% of total industrial SO2 emission in 2007, indicating that SO2 emission tend to have more significant link with industrial production and thus with local economic growth, which may further produce certain impact on political promotion of local officials. It further implies that better environmental governance may harm economic growth, or in other words, higher environmental pollution is conducive to enhanced economic performance, thus increasing the like- lihood of promotion. Furthermore, similar to an earlier find- ing, the parameters of COD, SOOT, and NHx still present weak influence on the turnover mode of municipal party secretary. Concerning the results of other control variables, as antic- ipated, our findings indicate that CCYL and Experience (ex- cept for models 1, 3, and 6) increase the probability of pro- motion, while the variable Tenure shows that a longer length of term has a lower probability of promotion in models (2)–(5). The variable Age also has the expected negative and statistically significant coefficient in all equations, implying that older party secretaries are more likely to lower the Table 3 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, SO2 Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.25 (5.49)** 0.33 (14.12)** 0.92 (23.10)** 0.71 (3.59) ** SO2 0.19 (1.20) 0.29 (0.60) − 0.50 (− 1.40) GDP 0.64 (4.33)** 0.23 (7.62)** 0.57 (7.95)** CCYL 0.25 (2.71)** 0.25 (6.72)** 1.88 (7.00) ** 0.17 (0.70) Experience 0.18 (1.11) 0.07 (2.54)** 0.84 (4.97) ** 1.93 (6.45) ** Tenure − 0.13 (− 0.23) − 0.69 (− 3.61)** Age − 0.01 (− 0.14) 0.51 (1.04) Education 0.33 (3.32)** 0.43 (3.92) ** Population 0.22 (2.33)** 1.44 (2.94) ** Log likelihood − 166.90 − 133.87 − 315.87 − 376.99 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1256 1334 1232 1308 Z statistics in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively; 1 if a municipal party secretary is under promotion; otherwise, 0 Table 4 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, COD Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.18 (3.44)** 0.72 (4.44)** 0.99 (22.92) ** 1.32 (20.89) ** COD − 0.08 (− 0.66) 0.29 (0.60) 0.51 (1.04) GDP 1.03 (6.51) ** 0.25 (3.42)** 0.89 (78.82)** CCYL 0.09 (0.63) 0.84 (3.18)** 0.88 (12.24) ** 2.23 (7.62)** Experience 0.01 (0.04) 0.11 (0.72) 0.89 (78.82) ** 1.88 (7.00) ** Tenure − 1.35 (− 2.49) ** − 0.19 (− 1.20) Age 0.28 (0.80) 0.12 (0.76) Education 1.95 (5.75) ** 0.25 (5.49)** Population 1.25 (6.36)** 0.84 (4.97) ** Log likelihood − 348.14 − 342.31 − 294.35 − 270.31 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1108 1204 1322 1262 Notes: Same as Table 2 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='probability of promotion. We finally demonstrate that Education and Population (except for model (1)) are less like- ly to enhance a promotion with a weak significant effect on the turnover of municipal party secretary. Conclusion and implications By using a panel conditional logit model and multinomial logit regression, this research examines the relationship between environmental governance and political turnover of party secretaries in a panel of 113 cities in China using annual data over the period 2002–2013. Overall, our re- sults demonstrate that most pollution variables do not have significant impacts on the turnover of municipal par- ty secretaries in China. We even offer evidence that an increase of SO2 is associated with the enhancement of the likelihood of promotion when using the panel multi- nomial logit approach. In particular, we provide evidence that a higher GDP growth rate is usually combined with a higher likelihood of promotion for municipal leaders, which also goes for professional experience as well as personal ties as members of the Chinese Communist Youth League. Working experience in the party and gov- ernment also helps the secretaries have a greater probabil- ity of being promoted, whereas a long tenure has a strong negative influence on the likelihood of promotion for par- ty secretaries. Alternatively, evidence shows that age is less likely to influence a promotion, and educational level and city population play insignificant roles in determining the turnover of municipal party secretaries in China. From the conclusions mentioned above, it is clear in China that the performance of environmental governance is not a necessary criterion for promotions of municipal party secretaries; even a more serious environmental con- tamination can lead to the promotion of a municipal party secretary. Like the arguments proposed by Wu et al. (2013), this is mainly because worse environmental Table 5 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, SOOT Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.43(3.92) ** 0.69(3.61) ** 1.44(2.94) ** 6.57(7.95) ** SOOT 0.17(0.70) −0.01(−0.02) 0.04(0.28) GDP 1.93(6.45) ** 1.35(2.49) ** 0.12(2.37)** CCYL 1.72(4.44) ** 0.56 (2.10)** 0.44(1.78)* 0.05(0.45) Experience 1.03(6.51) ** 0.23 (3.10)** 029(5.12)** 0.13(2.09)** Tenure −1.95(−5.75) ** 0.08(0.041) Age 0.11(0.72) 0.37(1.81)* Education 0.28(0.80) 0.43(3.69)** Population 0.33 (9.37)** 0.29(15.79)** Log likelihood −334.98 −321.88 −323.09 −209.03 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1208 1322 1222 1150 Notes: Same as Table 2 Table 6 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, NHx Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.12 (2.83)** 0.11 (1.78)* 0.37 (1.91)* 0.46 (4.20)** NHx 0.06 (0.38) − 0.42 (− 2.15)** 0.15 (1.42) GDP 0.06 (3.47)** 0.09 (3.99)** 0.06 (2.08)** CCYL 0.30 (2.97) ** 0.03 (1.75)* 0.04 (1.85)* 0.96 (2.06)** Experience − 0.02 (− 0.60) 0.16 (6.62)** 0.15 (7.08)** 0.35 (4.07) ** Tenure − 0.08 (− 1.20) − 0.19 (− 3.09)** Age 0.18 (1.06) 0.37 (1.03) Education 0.48 (1.72)* 0.32 (1.08) Population 0.96 (2.06)** 0.35 (4.07) ** Log likelihood − 265.99 − 323.88 − 323.80 − 209.88 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1086 1126 1286 1308 Notes: Same as Table 2 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='contamination is associated with higher industrial produc- tion and a higher local GDP growth rate, and most offi- cials choose to drive economic growth as a development goal. We thus note that policymakers in both central and local governments should take note of such a phenomenon. We also offer some policy implications from our pa- per’s results. There does not exists obvious relationship between environmental performance and the promotion mechanism of municipal party secretary, mainly because most existing environmental performance appraisals are mere formalities and lose their function of a political in- centive (Ran 2013). However, the results of panel multi- nomial logit regression show that increasing SO2 is linked with higher likelihood of political promotion, implying that intensive industrial production does promote local economy and finally contributes to municipal secretaries’ political promotion. As we stated earlier, local officials’ response to promotion incentives more directly correlate to other mechanisms; therefore, the most efficient way to promote environmental governance in a local area is to link environmental performance with promotions. Thus, the priority is to make local officials pay greater attention on environmental governance, and policymakers in the central government should formulate evaluative indicators for measuring the environmental pollution of municipal- level cities. Furthermore, like most previous studies in the literature have mentioned before, our study also proves that local economic performance is the most crucial factor for officials’ promotion, as the fact that greater economic performance leads to a higher likelihood of promotion. It implies that the most conducive path for local officials’ promotion should be to try and improve environmental governance without hindering local economic growth; the local officials ought to try their best to improve energy efficiency, develop innovative technologies, increase the access to clean energy, and balance the interests between environment and economy.

Since previous scholars have never investigated the relationships between political turnover and environmental governance at the municipal level, in this work, we proxy pollution by SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx and examine whether environmental performance affects the political turnover of the municipal party secretary by exploiting a panel conditional logit with a fixed-effect model for the period 2002 – 2013. The results indicate that environmental performance does not significantly impact the turnover of municipal party secretaries, offering evidence that an increase of SO2 is associated with the likelihood of promotion under the panel multinomial logit approach. However, a higher GDP growth rate plays the determinant factor affecting the promotion of China’s municipal party secretaries.

Using a unique dataset of Chinese cities, we find that the system leads to a significant increase in the number of promoted officials, but also to a decline in their subsequent performance. We then provide evidence that the system distorts bureaucrats’ allocation of effort across different tasks, and that this distortion is more severe for bureaucrats who face stronger career concerns. Our findings suggest that the system induces a tradeoff between incentivizing effort and distorting the allocation of effort, and highlight the importance of considering the multitasking nature of bureaucratic jobs when designing performance evaluation systems.',\n",

Local leaders signal competence when their superiors actively collect evidence to evaluate their performances: these are years leading to the end of a five-year term. To create better economic performances, local leaders lessen the enforcement of environmental regulations to reduce local industries’ production costs and/or to attract firms from other jurisdictions. Such selective enforcement creates an environmental political business cycle in which pollution increases in years leading to the year of leader turnover. The empirical analysis on a panel of Chinese prefectures of 2002–2010 reveals a U-shaped relationship between a prefecture’s party secretary’s years in office and its average annual PM2.5 level.',\n",

A relative standard for corruption consequently arises since non-implementation of laws may be mandate-serving or may be corrupt; and determining which requires extra information on why non-implementation occurred. The theory is supported by evidence from original survey and case research on the implementation of the village elections law. I discuss implications for anticorruption efforts, development patterns, and future research.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'This article examines the political budget cycles in Chinese counties. The shift to a more performance-based cadre evaluation and mobility system during the reform era has created an incentive structure for local leaders to increase government spending at strategically important time points during their tenure to enhance the prospect of official promotion. Such expenditures help local leaders to impress their superiors with economic and political achievements, especially those visible and quantifiable large-scale development projects. At the same time, economic and fiscal decentralization increased the capacity of local leaders to influence government budget expenditures as the need rises. The hypothesized curvilinear relationship between a leader’s time in office and increased spending was tested using a comprehensive data set of all Chinese counties from 1997 through 2002. The panel data analysis shows that growth in local government spending per capita is the fastest during a leader’s third and fourth years in office.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'Spectacular economic growth in China suggests the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP) has somehow gotten it right. A key hypothesis in both economics and political science is that the CCP’s cadre evaluation system, combined with China’s geography-based governing logic, has motivated local administrators to compete with one another to generate high growth. We raise a number of theoretical and empirical challenges to this claim. Using a new biographical database of Central Committee members, a previously overlooked feature of CCP reporting, and a novel Bayesian method that can estimate individual-level correlates of partially observed ranks, we ﬁnd no evidence that strong growth performance was rewarded with higher party ranks at any of the postreform party congresses. Instead, factional ties with various top leaders, educational qualiﬁcations, and provincial revenue collection played substantial roles in elite ranking, suggesting that promotion systems served the immediate needs of the regime and its leaders, rather than encompassing goals such as economic growth.',\n",

       "  'abstract': 'The political incentives of local officials affect their preferences for policy options. This study examines the impact of the convening cycle of Provincial Communist Party Congresses (PCPCs) in China on pollution emission intensity. Based on the data of 281 cities and city officials from 2003 to 2014, the present study finds strong evidence of a political pollution cycle manifesting as significant increases in pollution emission intensity before PCPCs followed by visible decreases after PCPCs. PCPCs provide city officials with strong political incentives to pursue short-term economic performance before congresses, which leads to a surge in pollution emission intensity. The difference in pollution emission intensity before and after the PCPCs reveals the existence of such political incentives. The findings suggest that a significant relationship exists between the political incentives of city officials and environmental pollution. Therefore, the effective governance of environmental pollution must involve changing the incentive structure of city officials.',\n",

We collect party secretary data for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure promotion patterns. We construct county-year SO2 and PM2.5 pollution measures using NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coef ﬁ cient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who are able to reduce air pollution are more likely to be promoted. We  ﬁ nd similar results for county magistrates.

       "  'abstract': 'China’s new development wave since the mid-1990s is distinguishable by its strong urbanism. Urban governments, particularly at municipal and county levels, rushed to build industrial parks. Urban landscape was also fundamentally transformed by their massive investments in infrastructures – both residential and commercial properties. How to explain local governments’ continuing drive for development? Why has this particular policy combination gained traction among local officials? We approach these questions by making a simple assumption about local governments as revenue maximisers. Their desires for more revenues are constrained by two institutional changes. Vertically, the central government recentralised the fiscal system, leaving local governments in fiscal shortages. Liberalisation and regional competition in the late 1990s further exacerbated their revenue imperative. The land regime provided the final institutional link that enabled local officials to leverage urban infrastructure and real estate for industrial expansion. This study can shed some light on the ongoing debate about China’s development model in the urban literature.',\n",

The central government has control over personnel, whereas subnational governments run the bulk of the economy; and they initiate, negotiate, implement, divert, and resist reforms, policies, rules, and laws.

Taking advantage of China’s institutional setup with ample bureaucratic transfers, the paper estimates leaders’ capabilities as their personal contributions to local economic growth. The paper finds strong evidence of political business cycles – a typical form of political opportunism – as manifested by a significant boost in the growth rate preceding the Communist Party’s national congress. However, more capable leaders are found to generate more modest political business cycles than less capable ones do. The findings suggest that, to the extent that political selections are associated with the long term reputation of officials, career-concerned opportunism is at least partially moderated by the selection of capable officials in China. The paper provides supportive evidence for the reputation model of political business cycles as well as enriches the study of government officials in weak institutional environments.',\n",
