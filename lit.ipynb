A relative standard for corruption consequently arises since non-implementation of laws may be mandate-serving or may be corrupt; and determining which requires extra information on why non-implementation occurred. The theory is supported by evidence from original survey and case research on the implementation of the village elections law.

INTRODUCTION Corruption in China is widely seen as an intractable prob- lem despite the fact that the ruling Communist Party has pub- licly prioritized ﬁghting corruption and issued ambitious reforms to do so. While studies of corruption in China have illuminated much about the patterns, causes, and conse- quences of corruption, there remains the puzzle of why the re- gime has so much diﬃculty ﬁghting corruption despite the use of its powerful oversight and disciplinary systems. Prominent existing explanations for the regime’s failure focus on lack of central commitment, resistance from local oﬃcials, and too- limited strategies. Beyond these factors, in this paper I propose an underappreciated institutional explanation: that China has a governing system in which it is inherently diﬃcult to even identify corruption. This explanation may seem counterintuitive, given the repu- tation of the Chinese Communist Party for invasive monitor- ing, but here I show why it may be an important missing part of the equation. My reasoning is not premised on the notion that the party’s information on its oﬃcials is especially poor, but rather on the idea that the information the party requires to identify what it would count as “corruption” is unusually great and hard to obtain. This additional information burden arises, I argue, as a consequence of China’s particular govern- ing system, which I call a “rule of mandates” system, as op- posed to a more familiar rule of law system. Under a “rule of mandates,” the regime does not hold its oﬃcials accountable to ﬁxed standards but rather to relative standards. Instead of directing oﬃcials to implement the re- gime’s laws and policies unconditionally, the party directs them to implement a subset of “mandates” according to their relative prioritization. As I invoke the term here, mandates do not simply represent an alternate set of laws parallel to the public body of laws. In contrast to a body of laws, mandates are directives that are hierarchically ranked against each other. Lower oﬃcials are expected to give more weight to the higher priority mandates, and they are authorized to adjust the imple- mentation of laws and lower priority mandates to aim at the desired ends. In this system, the implementation of laws is thus conditional on their compatibility with higher priority mandates. Under both a rule of mandates and a rule of law, we can think of corruption as occurring when oﬃcials deviate from the duties of public oﬃce for personal gain. Yet, identifying such a deviation from the duties of public oﬃce is much more straightforward under a rule of law system than under a rule of mandates system. When laws govern, the failure to imple- ment laws and policies—a readily observable measure—is an indicator of a potentially serious problem, likely corruption. Yet when mandates govern, oﬃcials’ failures to implement policies and laws are not red ﬂags for corruption, so long as the deviations do not involve policies designated with the high- est priority. The oﬃcials might have exercised their discretion to decide that a lower priority mandate, like environmental protection programs and the relevant laws, should not be lo- cally implemented lest it hinder a higher priority mandate, like economic growth. Thus, in a rule of mandates system, the standard for corruption is a relative one. To have reasonable suspicion that oﬃcials are corrupt, leaders also need to evalu- ate why a law or policy was not implemented (unless the pol- icies are designated as highest priority), not just see that it was not implemented. The information needed to make such an evaluation is detailed, costly to collect, diﬃcult to analyze, and often unavailable. In Part I of this paper, I develop the theoretical argument above and relate it to diﬀerent ways of deﬁning corruption and the problem of detecting corruption. In Parts II, III, and IV of this paper, I ground the theory in survey and case evidence consistent with its arguments. While the data are not adequate to establish where corruption exists, it does establish that, under a rule of mandates, lower oﬃcials can easily veil corruption behind the rhetoric of meeting man- dates. Original evidence pertaining to the implementation of China’s village elections law is used to show that the rule of * I am very grateful to numerous colleagues for their invaluable input, most especially Pierre Landry, Susan Rose-Ackerman, Ian Shapiro, Shiru Wang, and Lynn White.

       " Document(page_content='mandates system makes corruption particularly diﬃcult to de- tect in China. First, I show that it is diﬃcult for higher oﬃcials to obtain accurate information on the base line situation, the extent to which the election law was implemented in locales. Reports from local oﬃcials often seem unreliable when com- pared to reports from surveyed villagers. Second, I show that it is even more diﬃcult to interpret why the elections law was poorly implemented, as local oﬃcials generally claim that their interference with village elections was for the purpose of promoting one of the highest priority mandates, namely political “stability,” even as the evidence is that their interference does not do so. Case study evidence shows how local oﬃcials may actually sometimes be hiding be- hind the mandates to shelter their own corruption. In Part V, I conclude with a discussion of three implications. First, I underscore how the relationship between decentraliza- tion and corruption depends on broader governing institu- tions. Second, I discuss the possibility that a rule of mandates might be used in developmental ways and yet still destabilize over the long term. Third, I discuss why common approaches to anticorruption that are compatible with a rule of law are in tension with a rule of mandates. 2. THE RULE OF MANDATES AND THE CHALLENGES OF DETECTING CORRUPTION China is relatively decentralized ﬁscally, yet centralized politically, in large part through a system of targets and incen- tives that control local cadres and inﬂuence which policies and laws they implement. Collectively, we can think of the targets and incentives as authoritarian mandates from above. Man- dates diﬀer from laws principally in that they are attached to hierarchical rankings such that higher priority mandates take precedence over lower priority ones. In practice in China, mandates are also typically hidden from the public, regard fewer issues in less detail, and call for adherence to particular outcomes rather than particular processes. These additional features also distinguish typical mandates from typical laws, but should not be mistaken for their deﬁning feature. The key fact that mandates are ranked against each other means that not all policies need to be, or should be, pursued locally, depending on how they interact with each other and local con- ditions. Under a rule of mandates, lower oﬃcials are given signiﬁ- cant discretion; they are authorized to adjust the implementa- tion of laws and lower priority mandates as they aim at the desired outcomes. This means that the standards for corrup- tion are eﬀectively relative rather than absolute, as explained below. This system is useful for the regime because it ensures that high priority targets will be locally implemented even when central oﬃcials have little knowledge of the local imple- mentation challenges. Yet, I argue, one major drawback of the rule of mandates paradigm for China is that it makes it espe- cially diﬃcult to reliably detect potentially corrupt behavior. Because variations in the local implementation of central pol- itics are supposed to occur under a rule of mandates, higher oﬃcials must know why variations occur in order to judge if the variations are the result of good-faith eﬀorts to meet man- dates or corruption. In this system, local corruption can easily mask itself as deference to the centralized mandates. (a) The rule of mandates model in China China’s system for maintaining political control of lower level oﬃcials relies on well-deﬁned incentives and sanctions designed to uphold party directives (Landry, 2008). Broad party directives, which are separate from if sometimes consis- tent with the public law, are issued at the highest level. Consis- tently among the highest national priorities are economic development, social stability, and the birth control policy, which are measured by ﬁgures such as income per capita, inci- dences of collective protests, and the population growth rate. At lower levels, more speciﬁcs are developed about the exact targets, priorities, reporting requirements, rewards for success, and penalties for failure; these thus vary from area to area. Lo- cal leaders now actually sign contracts that acknowledge the targets and terms surrounding them. The most serious targets are those with veto power (yipiao foujue), followed by hard targets (ying zhibiao), and soft targets (yiban zhibiao) (Hei- mer, 2006). Some laws and issues are such low priority that there are no targets corresponding to them. Most important of all for cadres are the veto-level targets. If a township fails to meet targets with veto power by the end-of- the-year evaluation, the failure would eliminate all credit to township leaders for other successes achieved that year (Edin, 2003). Poor performance evaluations may not only result in the loss of an annual bonus or prospects for promotion of individual oﬃcials, but may even result in large ﬁnes and pen- alties for all their colleagues. In other words, the “cadre responsibility system” makes extensive use of strict liability, collective liability, and vicarious liability (Minzner, 2009). Col- lective responsibility implies that oﬃcials have an institution- alized individual incentive to aid their colleagues—or equally, to overlook or assist false reporting by their col- leagues. Mandates are pre-set, often by formula, and cover only a limited number of items that are hierarchically ranked against each other. For items that are high priority, accountability is tightly tied to apparent outcomes; for items that are low prior- ity or not explicitly mentioned, there may be limited or no accountability at all. For instance, in one Shanghai county studied by Susan Whiting, growth in township- and village- run industries was worth up to 33 points, and “party building” activities like educating party members were worth 21 points—and provision of public education was worth only nine points (out of a possible total of 200 points). The speciﬁc formula used to evaluate performance in these areas was fur- ther speciﬁed, and depended on quantitative data such as the “increase in industrial proﬁts” and “the completion rate for compulsory education” (Whiting, 2004). With such criteria, at its best, the cadre responsibility system is set up to incentiv- ize a precise but narrow space of accountability. At its worst, it does not incentivize actual accountability but only apparent accountability, since the criteria for evaluation are often not directly visible to higher cadres so data may be easily fudged or made up by lower cadres. Variation in the local implementation of laws is thus an inherent outcome of the rule of mandates, even in the absence of corruption. To meet the mandates, cadres are supposed to adjust the implementation of lower priority laws and policies to better meet higher priority targets. Moreover, unless public grievances pertain to a target, public pressure may be safely ig- nored by cadres. Eﬀective public grievances are partly man- aged by secrecy; as explicit as the targets are to cadres, they remain mysterious to the public. Party directives and contracts are generally treated as conﬁdential internal documents, so that the public generally remains unaware of the speciﬁcs or even the existence of them. At the same time, targets do not necessarily correspond to public laws let alone local public preferences, nor are they subject to them. In fact, in indicating to cadres which laws and issues to prioritize, and which they 56 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='may safely ignore, the mandates drive deeply political choices about which the public is usually in the dark. (b) Relative standards for corruption Since local variation in the implementation of laws and pol- icies is an inherent goal of the rule of mandates, impermissible variations—those implying corruption—must be distinguished from permissible variations. Accordingly, common deﬁnitions of corruption take on a diﬀerent meaning in the context of a rule of mandates. Deﬁnitions of corruption that are under- stood to invoke an absolute standard elsewhere actually in- voke a relative standard under China’s rule of mandates. By a relative standard, I mean that activities that are oﬃcially viewed as corruption under certain circumstances are not viewed as corruption under other circumstances, since local oﬃcials are given discretion to adjust the implementation of laws to achieve higher political priorities. To illustrate this, consider one widely used deﬁnition of cor- ruption, as the “misuse” or “abuse of public oﬃce for private gain” (Manion, 2004; Rose-Ackerman, 1999; The World Bank, 1997). Under this deﬁnition, the law is commonly used as the absolute benchmark for corruption. As Svensson writes, “Misuse, of course, typically involves applying a legal stan- dard” (italics mine) (Svensson, 2005). By a legal standard, this deﬁnition of corruption encompasses practices that are against the law, such as bribery, extortion, embezzlement, or manipu- lating elections. However, in China, these practices may not always be against the mandates, because, ﬁrst, the mandates set diﬀerent standards than the law, and second, the standards they set are relative ones. On the ﬁrst point, mandates may set diﬀerent standards than the law or imply contradictory standards. For instance, even though the law states that village heads should be elected by villagers and that any eligible voter can be elected, one com- mon mandate states that village heads should be party mem- bers, implying that electoral choice might need to be curtailed. For another instance, even though embezzlement and extortion are against Chinese criminal law, mandates sometimes distinguish minor malfeasances as a separate, less signiﬁcant category. Oﬃcials are often given exemption from prosecution for cases involving limited monetary amounts, sometimes even if legal action has already been started (Man- ion, 2004). Instead, they might be modestly disciplined by the party. Although this approach might appear to represent a corrupt “rule of man” in which oﬃcials are modifying rules at whim, it is in fact rule-abiding if the relevant rules are man- dates rather than laws. Thus, when mandates are used as the standard for corruption, as they are by the Communist Party in China, the meaning of “abuse” or “misuse” of public oﬃce is often diﬀerent than when laws are used as the standard. The same technical deﬁnition of corruption—as the abuse of public oﬃce for private gain—takes on a diﬀerent, non-law-based meaning under regime standards. Second, under mandates, the standards for corruption are relative rather than absolute. Since the distinctive features of mandates is that they are hierarchically ranked, what consti- tutes “abuse” or “misuse” may additionally depend on circum- stances and motives. Recognizing that implementing the full slate of mandates is impossible for most local governments, the rule of mandates allows non-implementation of lower pri- ority mandates including laws. For instance, oﬃcials do not have to implement village elections, even though it is the na- tional law, in places where they might threaten the highest pri- ority mandate, social stability. However, oﬃcials are not supposed to cancel or undermine elections for the sake of personal gain, versus party objectives. The same logic may be applied to whether or not low priority laws like environ- mental protection, historical preservation, or government open information acts should be implemented when they potentially create a conﬂict with higher priority goals like eco- nomic development or social stability. This relative standard for corruption grows out of an insti- tutional diﬀerence, a mandate-based governing system versus a law-based governing system. Thus, it is distinctive from cul- tural explanations for shifts in the meaning of corruption, although both provide reasons why corruption and law imple- mentation might vary across units under a single governing structure. While cultural diﬀerences may also generate relative standards for corruption (Triesman, 2000), the degree of cor- ruption in China cannot be fully explained by the values of the Chinese public (Sandholtz & Taagepera, 2005). Indeed, from a cultural standpoint, the Chinese public may be increasingly in- clined toward an absolute legal standard for corruption. O’Brien and Li argue that public laws have set new expecta- tions for the public, such that they feel entitled to rights they never historically enjoyed (O’Brien & Li, 2006). This means there is a potential gap between what the public might count as corruption and what oﬃcials might count as such. The for- mer might be concerned with what we could call law-violating corruption (an absolute standard) whereas the latter are fo- cused on mandate-violating corruption (a relative standard). (c) Higher information requirement to detect corruption A consequence of the relative standards for corruption is a heightened information requirement to detect corruption. Since the system authorizes uneven implementation of non- priority laws and policies, oﬃcials must generally not only know that a law or policy was violated, but why it was vio- lated. As I explore below, non-implementation of the village elections law would be acceptable if in the service of a higher mandate like stability or development, but corrupt if designed to facilitate personal theft of village assets. For another exam- ple, if illegal taxes are levied, the action could be viewed as accountable if the funds were redirected to support a priority unfunded mandate, perhaps a capital outlay for an infrastruc- ture project. Even if the funds were redirected into the salaries of local oﬃcials, this still might accord with mandates, since local oﬃcials’ salaries are often unfunded or underfunded, plus more oﬃcials might have to be hired to ensure tax collec- tion (Lin, Tao, & Liu, 2003). But if the reason for the illegal taxes was so an individual oﬃcial could simply pocket the funds, the behavior would be more akin to extortion or cor- rupt rent-seeking. Thus, depending on circumstances, an iden- tical activity could be interpreted as mandate-abiding or as a form of corruption. Such activities could range from graft to rent-seeking to prebendalism (Lu¨, 2000), i.e., non-monetary corruption. This heightened information burden (that more information is needed) is in addition to any information detection prob- lems (that information is hard to obtain), so the corruption monitoring problem is magniﬁed under a rule of mandates. Standard methods of detecting corruption in a rule of law con- text, such as investigating deviations in implementation, not- ing illegal fees and transfers, and public oversight, do not provide the required information on why laws and policies may have been violated with reference to mandates. Consis- tent with this, in recent history, China’s approach to detecting corruption relies on party agencies that begin investigations in response to reports of party member misconduct, in contrast to the public security approach of beginning with a crime DECENTRALIZATION AND VEILED CORRUPTION UNDER CHINA’S “RULE OF MANDATES” 57', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",

The need for greater information and the diﬃculty of obtaining it mean that corruption in a rule of mandates environment is more eas- ily veiled. 3. THE RULE OF MANDATES AND VILLAGE ELECTIONS IN CHINA In this and the following two sections, I use empirical evidence to ground the theory that corruption in China is par- ticularly hard to detect because it can mask itself as mandate- driven variations in policy implementation. I choose to examine evidence surrounding the implementation of China’s national law requiring village elections, for three reasons. First, the na- tional law sets a universal standard for when village elections should be held. Since 1998, all administrative villages, which are the lowest administrative units in rural areas, should have competitive public elections that meet minimum procedural requirements set out in the Organic Law on Villager Elections. Second, the extent of implementation is widely observable by villagers, so it is possible to assess implementation without rely- ing on oﬃcial reports, through surveying villagers as I do here. Third, there are two main competing reasons for oﬃcials to fail to implement village elections: they might be corrupt, or they might be trying to meet party mandates that subordinate village elections to critical targets such as social stability. By exploring the gap between the legal standard for village elections and the reality of their implementation, and by examining the ambigu- ity over why this gap exists, I illuminate how China’s rule of mandates can veil corruption. Village elections are useful to the CCP overall, and local oﬃ- cials are expected to implement them unless they conﬂict with higher priorities. The establishment of village elections in China was the controversial solution to a crisis of party legit- imacy in the countryside that was believed to be driven by par- asitic local leaders (Wang, 1997). By eﬀectively delegating to the public certain duties normally performed by township and county authorities (to select, discipline, and monitor cer- tain village leaders), top authorities hoped to overcome the authoritarian system’s information problems, save the energy and political capital of higher oﬃcials for other tasks, and shed responsibility for disliked village leaders and contentious politics (Alpermann, 2003; He & Lang, 2002; O’Brien & Li, 2000). In essence, they hoped to enlist villagers as occasional agents of the higher government in disciplining its everyday lo- cal agents, the village oﬃcials. For the elections to achieve this objective, they would need to be at least semi-competitive— not just for show. In line with this, an increasing body of evi- dence is showing that village elections are able to challenge vil- lage establishments and create better governing at the village level. At that lowest level, elections seem to bring about more trustworthy leaders, more political responsiveness, fairer land allocations, and increases in public goods (Birney, 2007; Brandt & Turner, 2003; Luo, Zhang, Huang, & Rozelle, 2007; Martinez-Bravo, Miquel, Qian, & Yao, 2011; O’Brien & Han, 2009). To the extent that elections are eﬀective in creating weak accountability to the public, they serve both the public and re- gime interests in political stability. Consistent with this role of village elections, central authorities have established minimal incentives for lower oﬃcials to implement village elections, at least to some degree. For instance, two of the variables that may ﬁgure into the evaluation of township and county govern- ments are the percentage of turnout in the village elections and the percentage of “failed elections” (elections not held to completion). The former has resulted in heavy mobilization of voters. While many voters may be reluctant or uninterested, especially when the elections are not particularly competitive, the relatively high turnout rates and public awareness of vot- ing is certainly partially attributable to the turnout targets. Failed elections may occur when the township decides to can- cel an election, when no one candidate gets a majority in the ﬁrst round and the township does not bother to hold a second round, when voter turnout is below 50%, or when serious problems occur. At the same time, the regime appears wary that village elec- tions may create accountability that is much stronger than it would like and ultimately destabilizing for Communist Party rule. After all, if the elections are not somewhat controlled, wouldn’t villagers be able to use the elections to instead de- mand that village oﬃcials act as their own agents in interfacing with higher levels of government? This possibility that elec- tions would inspire elected oﬃcials to try place pressure on higher oﬃcials, working together with villagers or collectively across villages, is not just hypothetical. In one dramatic exam- ple in Shandong province, 57 elected village heads in the Qixia area resigned en masse to make a statement, following re- peated and unsuccessful petitions to higher levels to discipline local party oﬃcials for the embezzlement of public funds, political violence, and other illegal activities (Beech, 2001; Eckholm, 2002). The mass resignation can be taken as both evidence of their own abilities to coordinate and the unwilling- ness of the party at any level to address their grievances. The idea that village elections would facilitate signiﬁcant political pressure beyond the village level is contrary to the purpose for which the regime created them. Elsewhere, I have argued that China’s system of internal authoritarian rule, the rule of mandates system described above, places a dynamic check on the possibility of unintended consequences of village elec- tions beyond the village level. Therefore, instances such as the Qixia one are not as common as they would otherwise be. This is because township or other mid-level oﬃcials can adjust the implementation of the village election law in their area, should they expect that the outcomes would hinder their top priority objectives. Thus, the optimal situation for the regime is that the village elections law be implemented to the degree it helps create sta- bility (by generating weak accountability of poorly-monitored village oﬃcials to the public), and no more than that (in order to evade the destabilizing eﬀects of strong accountability). In short, the optimal situation is to strike a balance. China’s rule of mandates system allows this balance to be achieved with a fair amount of precision, as it incentivizes local oﬃcials to ad- just village election implementation in order to meet centrally- mandated targets. The regime eﬀectively delegates to township-level oﬃcials the responsibility for striking a balance between the stabilizing and destabilizing eﬀects of village elections. It does so through the high prioritization of the “social stability” mandate, which in China, refers to a directive to maintain political stability. This central directive to avoid political tensions with the pub- lic translates, at lower levels, into speciﬁc targets to prevent collective public political activities. Typical stability targets mandate a low threshold for the manifestation of collective protests, collective complaints, and petitions to higher levels. These targets seem to be generally set as veto-level (the high- est) targets. The social stability veto targets may sometimes help and sometimes hinder the implementation of the elections law, depending on local circumstances and the discretionary judgment of local oﬃcials. Mid-level oﬃcials realize that good 58 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",

But, especially when there is a contentious issue like a land dispute with the higher gov- ernment, authorities might also fear that the election of an outsider would provide stronger leadership and organization to discontented villagers. Or, even if an elected outsider did not threaten the stability target, he might use his position with- in the system to threaten other priority targets like economic development plans. The requirements of the elections law have less relevance to implementation than calculations about the degree of implementation that is most likely to meet the social stability target and minimally threaten other targets. As one county oﬃcial in charge of overseeing village elections ex- plained to me, an oﬃcial like him would never gain much from implementing elections well according to law, but his evalua- tion would take a severe hit if there were even a single protest or piece of negative media coverage that could be related to an election. At the same time that township leaders are supposed to ad- just the implementation of the village election laws to meet central mandates, they may be tempted to curtail elections for personal gain. There are certainly strong incentives for cor- rupt oﬃcials to interfere with village election to gain control of the village committee. Control of the village committee facili- tates control of all the village lands (villagers do not own their land, but rather the village does); access to the village coﬀers; the power to assess fees, spend and borrow; and the ability to fabricate or conceal village records. Control of the village land is especially valuable to corrupt oﬃcials when land sales, land leasing, or enterprises are possible. For instance, given the lack of transparency around transactions and accounts, a typical problem is that village oﬃcials will report that village land was sold for much less than the actual price in order to pocket the diﬀerence. Government grants from above may also be skimmed; for instance, farmers in Henan province in particu- lar beneﬁt from direct cash payments for grain subsidies, cash that must ﬁrst travel through the county and village coﬀers, making tempting opportunities for corrupt oﬃcials (Cheung, 2004). Under a rule of mandates, identifying corruption would re- quire, ﬁrst, determining that elections fell short of the law, and second, determining that the reason was not a good faith eﬀort to meet higher targets. Below, I show how diﬃcult it is estab- lish both of these matters, lending support to my theoretical argument that the rule of mandates system veils corruption through imposing a higher information requirement for iden- tifying corruption. (a) Description of the data To understand the extent of interference in village elections and assess the possibility that corruption plays a signiﬁcant role, I use original survey data from the 2005–06 China Village Democracy Survey in Shandong and Henan. Shandong and Henan provinces border each other, well-represent China’s heartland, and at the time of the survey were the country’s two largest provinces; together, they encompassed 14% of the country’s enormous population. The multilevel spatial sur- vey was collaboratively designed and implemented; analyses are my own. The data are usual in their depth of political con- tent, and also in containing village- and township-level infor- mation on top of individual-level information. It includes individual surveys of 574 respondents over 14 townships and 26 administrative villages; qualitative interviews with the vil- lage leaderships; village election historical data; and interviews with supervising township oﬃcials in China’s two most popu- lous provinces. These data are not suﬃcient to establish where corruption really occurred—though it would be ideal to examine data that could do so in a future study. Yet, it is suﬃcient to test the the- ory that corruption is veiled under a rule of mandates, that is, that because of relative standards of accountability, it is near impossible to distinguish corruption from mandate-compli- ance. 4. DETERMINING IMPLEMENTATION UNDER A RULE OF MANDATES Simply determining whether or not a law was implemented can be a challenge in China’s system of top-down oversight, which relies largely on reports by cadres who may have an incentive to mislead higher oﬃcials. Information that is re- vealed by the public—through petitions, protests, hotlines, and other self-initiated contact with oﬃcials—is frequently used as a check on reports that lower oﬃcials provide. In exceptional situations, investigatory teams may be sent to spe- ciﬁc locations to collect more information from locals, but ordinarily higher oﬃcials would not have much access to the information that villagers have on the local implementation of laws, as it is too costly to systematically collect, as we have done in the China Village Democracy Survey. Yet, much information is lost when the party relies so heavily on internal reports, as discrepancies often exist between the reports of cadres and the reports of villagers, sometimes substantial ones. As shown in the charts below, local oﬃcials seem to over-re- port the degree to which they implement elections laws. As Ta- ble 1 shows, oﬃcial records on the village elections in the China Village Democracy Survey indicated that all the villages had held elections. However, when interviewed, village leaders in one village admitted theirs had never been held. Moreover, the quality of the elections is often not in accordance with the national law, which demands that 100% of registered adult vil- lagers be allowed to vote. When asked if they were allowed to vote in the village election, in only 38% of the villages did 100% of registered adult villagers say they were allowed to vote. While enfranchisement was generally high, it was not uniformly so. In 15% of the villages, less than two thirds of registered adult villagers said they were allowed to vote. Among the reasons why villagers were eﬀectively disenfran- chised were “there was no election,” “only the men vote,” “only party members vote,” “only one member of each house- hold can vote,” and “I was never informed that there was an election.” From the standpoint of higher leaders, the fact that many villagers are eﬀectively disenfranchised is not a central con- cern. The mandates do not require that the letter of the elec- tion law is upheld, although they generally seem to award credit for holding an election on schedule, require 50% turnout for elections to be deemed “successful,” and award modest bo- nuses for meeting an array of other conditions. For instance, extra evaluation points might be obtained for holding the elec- tions within a certain timeframe or should it produce a winner who is a party member. Local oﬃcials are even brasher in misrepresenting the nom- ination process that they employ in village elections. As Table 2 shows, oﬃcial records on the village elections in the China Vil- lage Democracy Survey indicated that 85% of the villages had held a “sea election”-style (haixuan) nomination, that is, a nomination in which all villagers are eligible to vote for who they want the candidates to be. Yet, in only 69% of villages DECENTRALIZATION AND VEILED CORRUPTION UNDER CHINA’S “RULE OF MANDATES” 59', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='did village leaders make the same claim when interviewed. Meanwhile, only 15% of surveyed villagers across the villages reported being allowed to participate in a nomination process. In all, in 92% of villages, leaders or village records claimed a sea election nomination was held even though the reports from vil- lagers did not sustain the idea that a true sea election nomina- tion had happened in any of them. In 23% of villages, no one surveyed said they could participate in the nomination process, and in only one village did more than a third of surveyed villag- ers say they could participate in the nomination process. The discrepancy between the reports and the reality might be driven by the contradictory mandates that lower leaders face. While they are encouraged to hold sea election nominations—indeed, it is the oﬃcial policy in Shandong province—they are also held accountable for which types of people win the elections and the actions they might take later, so they have strong incentives from their mandates to control the openness of the nomination process in reality. Alternatively, they might choose to control the elections for reasons of corruption—a possibility taken up in the next section. The data above suggest how diﬃcult it is for the government to obtain accurate information on whether laws are being fully implemented. But the diﬃculty that higher oﬃcials face in assessing the performance of local oﬃcials is far greater than this problem alone. Under a rule of mandates, to detect cor- rupt behavior, the party must determine not only whether laws were ignored, but also why. As the next section shows, this is a massive additional challenge. 5. SUSPECTING CORRUPTION UNDER A RULE OF MANDATES When oﬃcials fail to implement the elections law, is it be- cause other mandates take priority or because the oﬃcial is corrupt or sheltering corrupt oﬃcials? Both are plausible. On the one hand, limiting the competitiveness of the elections reduces the probability that villagers could elect assertive vil- lage leaders who would stand in the way of the highest-priority mandates, like political stability, or the implementation of the one-child policy, or the pursuit of economic growth over eco- nomic equity. On the other hand, limiting the competitiveness of the elections increases the likelihood that corrupt oﬃcials can control the village committee with an eye to raiding the village coﬀers or making under-the-table real estate deals over valuable village land. In this section, I show how lower level oﬃcials in our sample normally explained their violations of village elections laws as Table 1.

       " Document(page_content='being in the interests of stability, when they explained it. Whether their claims are true or not is diﬃcult to assess— which is precisely the problem that higher oﬃcials face when trying to identify corruption by lower oﬃcials. One piece of evi- dence that is suggestive of either corrupt or incompetent behav- ior is that interference with village elections does not seem to produce the results claimed; that is, interference does not in- crease stability over time. This evidence cannot conclusively re- veal why interference actually occurred; but the point of this analysis is not to actually do so, but rather to reveal how diﬃ- cult it is to ascertain why oﬃcials violate elections laws. (a) Township interference in village elections Because township governments—the level of government di- rectly above the village level—are charged with overseeing vil- lage elections, in this section I analyze what causes townships to limit the implementation of village elections, and to dismiss or replace elected leaders. To do so, I analyze the qualitative reports from each of the villages in the sample. These reports are based on both close-ended interviews with township oﬃ- cials and open-ended interviews of village heads and village party secretaries, both conducted as part of the China Village Democracy Survey. One of the most striking revelations from these interviews is the astonishing amount of township inter- ference in village elections and the results. The interference, when explained, is usually justiﬁed by the purpose of main- taining “social stability,” the euphemism in China for the pre- vention of collective citizen activity and civic unrest, as shown in Table 3. The open-ended interviews underscore the enormous impor- tance of concerns about social stability in how the township engages with village politics and, in particular, implements vil- lage elections. Most townships seem to believe holding elec- tions will foment rather than limit further unrest. For instance, one township refused to allow a village election after villagers successfully petitioned them to dismiss a corrupt vil- lage leader. There is not clear evidence that the township was pursuing corrupt ulterior motives through its actions; after all, it supported the villagers in dismissing the allegedly corrupt leader. Rather, it seems to have wanted to avoid the possibility that villagers might collectively petition again—something that would be a black mark on the township’s record—by removing any ﬂashpoints for grievances. In doing so, the township overstepped the bounds of the law, but not necessar- ily the mandates, by refusing to hold the election. When the targets that are set up in China’s rule of mandates system are taken into account, the power and propensity of Table 2.

       " Document(page_content='the townships to violate elections laws makes sense. With so- cial stability such a critical target for local oﬃcials, townships seem to try to do as little as possible to rock the boat—which may mean avoiding elections much of the time or ignoring problems around them. For example, a top village oﬃcial re- ported that township oﬃcials did not bother to organize a sec- ond round of a recent election after the initial vote was unsuccessful, reportedly due to ballot stuﬃng. Instead, they asked the incumbent village head, who was not even seeking re-election, to continue in oﬃce. In another township, a top village oﬃcial reported that the township had asked the elected village head to resign in the name of social stability, after some election problems that the township had earlier de- clined to resolve led to villager complaints. He refused, yet the instance demonstrates the township’s disregard for the na- tional village elections law that only permits the voting public to recall elected oﬃcials, as well as its reactivity to potential instability. Much of the time, the actions of the township in the survey were justiﬁed as necessary to block or remove corrupt oﬃcials who might create local instability. Sometimes, townships seem to benevolently remove corrupt oﬃcials; in one village I visited outside the survey, a village party secretary was dismissed after it was discovered that he had secretly rented out the village hall to a business and was pocketing the rent. Consistent with the claim to be ﬁghting village-level corruption, the evidence is that townships interfere more in elections when there are high levels of local corruption, as measured by the reports of sur- veyed villagers. The relationship shown in Figure 1 is a statis- tically signiﬁcant one. But what is not clear from this data is whether townships typically interfere to deter and punish cor- rupt oﬃcials—versus to protect and assist corrupt allies. Certainly, cases in which allegedly corrupt townships inter- fere with village elections are widely reported in China. For in- stance, in another village that I visited outside the survey sample in Shandong province, higher oﬃcials allegedly refused to provide villagers with the legally required levels of compen- sation for land seizures, keeping the money for themselves.

       " Document(page_content='After an independent elected village head challenged them to provide the compensation and produce the past village accounting books, the next village election date was conve- niently moved by a year for supposedly administrative rea- sons, and widespread bribery ensued. Some villagers claim the township orchestrated the bribery, which they say ensured that the independent village head lost his re-election bid to a township lackey. The corruption accusations are unresolved, but resemble many other stories in which township oﬃcials control elections in order to sell land in a corrupt deal, or fake village records in order to skim funds rightfully belonging to villagers. Within the survey sample itself, the evidence also suggests not all townships intended to uphold stability or other high- priority mandates when they curtailed the implementation of elections, removed elected oﬃcials, or appointed oﬃcials to supposedly-elected oﬃces. Villagers and village leaders in one surveyed township have accused it of being in league with local maﬁas. What we know from the aggregate data is that the elections in one of their villages failed after the alleged widespread illegal use of proxy voting, the alleged cooperation of corrupt election oﬃcials, a spontaneous villager protest at the election, and the dramatic theft of one of the ballot boxes with all its ballots. The township responded by annulling the election and taking over the village government directly, ﬁlling the posts with township oﬃcials. From the standpoint of high- er oﬃcials, the township’s actions may seem designed to pre- vent further demonstrations, contention, public accusations, and such “instability.” Yet those same actions might instead, or in addition, be sheltering the corruption of township oﬃ- cials who could have orchestrated the ballot box theft so that they could install their own people in control of the village. The evidence is inconclusive. But this example well-illustrates that one price of a rule of mandates system is a substantially reduced ability to monitor and check corruption. At least in a rule of law system, deviations from the law would be easily recognized as corrupt or suspect. In a rule of mandates system, they are likely to be given the beneﬁt of the doubt—making corruption both more pervasive and harder to root out. There is a further reason to wonder if some townships in the survey are acting in a corrupt manner when they undermine elections: township interference in village elections does not seem to decrease friction between village leaders and the pub- lic, as one might expect it to do if done in order to achieve so- cial stability or root out corrupt elements. As Figure 2 shows, township interference does not increase the extent to which vil- lagers trust the village committee members, who are legally supposed to be elected. That relationship is statistically insig- niﬁcant; and if anything, the raw data seem to suggest a pos- sible negative relationship, which would be consistent with corrupt behavior. That said, because the n of this analysis is small, containing 26 villages, it is possible that a larger n is nec- essary to detect the true relationship if the true relationship is not strong. Yet, even if this is so, the weakness of the relation- ship is consistent with the idea that township interference has limited impact either way, implying either a corrupt motiva- tion or limited ability, and underscoring the diﬃculty of deter- mining whether illegal township actions are corrupt or mandate-complying. Altogether, the qualitative and quantitative data underscore that it is highly diﬃcult to obtain information on why the elec- tions law was poorly implemented. Local oﬃcials often claimed that their interference with village elections was for the purpose of promoting one of the highest priority man- dates, namely political “stability,” even as the evidence is that their interference does not do so. Case study evidence suggests that local oﬃcials may actually sometimes be hiding behind the mandates to shelter their own corruption. While we cannot say for certain whether this happened in the surveyed villages nor estimate the extent to which it happens, the relevant point is that it is very hard to tell why lower oﬃcials do what they do. And yet, under a rule of mandates system, it is essential to know what oﬃcials’ motives are since the standard for corrup- tion becomes a relative one. That is, the very same type of vio- lation of the village elections law would be viewed diﬀerently by overseeing oﬃcials depending on the motive. If the devia- tion from the national elections law were driven by an attempt to meet higher mandates given local circumstances, it would not be considered to constitute an “abuse of public oﬃce for private gain.” Otherwise, it would be considered corruption, invoking the same deﬁnition. Higher level oﬃcials would have the same diﬃculties that we confront here in trying to determine why township oﬃcials curtail village elections. Under a rule of mandates system, mandate-driven variations in the implementation of the elec- tion law are very diﬃcult to distinguish from corruption-dri- ven variations in implementation. 6. IMPLICATIONS In the paper, I have argued that China’s rule of mandates paradigm makes it particularly diﬃcult to identify corrupt oﬃ- cial behavior with certainty in China. The problem is not that the party has less information on its oﬃcials than it would un- der a rule of law paradigm, but rather that more information must be processed to identify corrupt behavior. Since a rule of mandates encourages oﬃcials to adjust the implementation of laws and policies in order to meet priority targets, variation in implementation is not an innate problem. In such a system, for all but the highest priority issues, oﬃcials must also know why variation occurred in order to determine how likely it is that corruption is present. A rule of mandates thus eﬀectively veils corruption. What are the implications of this research for approaches to ﬁghting corruption? Here I discuss, ﬁrst, that it underscores how the relationship between decentralization and corruption depends on broader governing institutions.

       " Document(page_content='opmental ways yet still destabilize over the long term. Here, I raise the question of whether it may be possible to strategically shift the locus of predatory corruption away from priority is- sue areas even as overall corruption is harder to control over the long term. Third, I discuss whether new models of anti- corruption reforms are needed for a rule of mandates. (a) How governing institutions shape the impact of decentralization on corruption A rule of mandates governing system represents a non-law- based form of decentralization in which some aspects of polit- ical accountability remain centralized, especially the determi- nation and enforcement of political priorities, even as other dimensions may be highly decentralized. This balance of cen- tralization and decentralization serves a purpose; it drives variations in the local implementation of laws in such a way that they serve regime priorities. Others have noted that the system of cadre accountability in China is robust, even when regime priorities change dramatically (Nathan, 2003); for in- stance, when top leaders switched their objectives from build- ing a communist state to building a capitalist state, the system responded (Heimer, 2006). Yet, attention has not been brought to how, given an agenda that is set at the top, the sys- tem contributes to diﬃculties in observing and thus controlling corruption. One of the main lessons of this paper is that cor- ruption may be particularly diﬃcult to root out in a political system like China’s, because the governing system inherently imposes a higher information requirement for detecting cor- ruption. This ﬁnding contributes to an emerging literature on the im- pact of decentralization and governing systems on corruption. To date, much of the research on how governing institutions aﬀect corruption has focused on democratic and/or liberal institutions (Svensson, 2005), such as the design of electoral systems (Kunicova & Rose-Ackerman, 2005; Persson & Tabel- lini, 2004) and press freedom (Besley & Burgess, 2001; Brunetti & Weder, 2003). Similarly, much research on how decentral- ization aﬀects corruption has taken place in democratic and/ or law-based contexts. This has illuminated a debate about whether and when improved accountability occurs under cen- tralization versus decentralization (Bardhan, 2002; Gerring & Thacker, 2004; Seabright, 1996). Yet non-law-based contexts also merit further independent attention as they may contain diﬀerent dynamics, as I hope I have shown in this paper. As I discuss below, these distinct dynamics may imply a diﬀerent pattern of impact and call for diﬀerent anticorruption strate- gies. (b) Is a rule of mandates developmental, corruption-enhancing, or both? While this paper has been about the detection of corruption, it also raises an intriguing pair of hypotheses about the impact of corruption on development and stability in China. Since oﬃcials might care to shift corrupt behavior into less detecti- ble arenas, could it be that the rule of mandates moderates the nature of corruption in high priority versus lower priority arenas? At the same time, since the rule of mandates veils cor- ruption, might it increase the aggregate amount of corruption? These hypotheses present avenues for further research and speak to major debates in the literature. One major puzzle about China is how development has pro- ceeded so rapidly in recent decades even as the state has been characterized as extensively corrupt. Some have postulated that corruption might be less harmful in China, perhaps due to high party discipline or a particular cultural heritage (Rock & Bonnett, 2004; Sun, 2004; Svensson, 2005). While illuminat- ing, this literature has had diﬃculty explaining why China’s top-down monitoring and disciplining system would be inef- fective at controlling corruption if party discipline is so high (Dimitrov, 2005) despite an array of apparently sincere anti- corruption reforms in recent years (Wedeman, 2012; Yang, 2004). Similarly, it is puzzling that economic development tar- gets do not incentivize more eﬀective anticorruption work when corruption might threaten development and develop- ment is a high priority mandate (Manion, 2004). The concept of a rule of mandates oﬀers a possible explanation for why there is party discipline in achieving high priority goals along- side enormous diﬃculty in identifying and ﬁghting corruption. The mandates may eﬀectively demand that a few high priori- ties are met, even as the resultant relative standards for cor- ruption help veil corruption. At the same time, the degree to which corruption is veiled by a rule of mandates—and thus patterns of corruption—might vary between the highest priority issues and lower priority is- sues. Since veto targets are mandatory or near mandatory, whereas other targets are discretionary, the simple existence of deviations from veto targets are suﬃcient to constitute red ﬂags for corruption or incompetence, whereas reliably detecting corruption in other arenas requires information on the reasons for deviations. This raises the question of whether a rule of mandates shifts corruption out of high priority areas into lower priority ones, or perhaps changes the nature of cor- ruption from predatory to developmental forms in high prior- ity areas. Comparative evidence already suggests that oﬃcials will shift corrupt activities away from higher detection activi- ties toward lower detection activities (Bardhan, 1997). For in- stance, large infrastructure projects may harbor more corruption because it is easier to maintain secrecy in this arena (Shleifer & Vishny, 1993). Research in China indicates that patterns of corruption and developmental activities are responsive to institutional restructuring (Ang, 2012; Chen, 2004). Further research might explore whether a rule of man- dates limits predatory corruption in veto-target, highest prior- ity areas in China (where less information is needed to detect corruption due to more absolute standards for corruption) even as it might increase it overall and in other areas (where more information is needed to detect corruption due to rela- tive standards for corruption). In doing so, such research would also help elaborate the particular costs and beneﬁts of a rule of mandates. (c) Political stability and anticorruption reforms under a rule of mandates How can eﬀective anticorruption measures be pursued un- der a rule of mandates system? This study implies that reforms should look for ways to diminish the additional monitoring problem that is created by the system’s relative standard for corruption. Also, since mandates regulate which laws are implemented, reforms should engage the mandates system, not simply the legal system. Two prescriptions that are typi- cally applied in rule of law situations—limiting the discretion given to local oﬃcials and enlisting the public in actively over- seeing local oﬃcials—are solutions that may be especially dif- ﬁcult to apply under a rule of mandates, as I discuss below. When it comes to village elections, reports to higher oﬃcials contain inaccurate—sometimes highly inaccurate informa- tion—on the implementation of provisions of the elections law. Reports from villagers may be more reliable but are cost- lier to obtain and interpret. Yet might there be a way for the 64 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='party to reduce the costs of collecting and applying villagers’ local knowledge by, for instance, institutionalizing more par- ticipatory processes? After all, comparative research has shown that one of the most eﬀective ways of preventing cor- ruption is to institutionalize local public oversight using dem- ocratic processes, at least under a rule of law paradigm. Unfortunately, unlike under a rule of law, higher leaders in a rule of mandates system do not seem to have incentives to directly enlist the independent public, media and civil society as monitors of corrupt oﬃcials. An authoritarian rule of mandates system makes it harder for the public to play a useful role in identifying corrupt oﬃcials. In part, this is because the authoritarian regime is generally wary of allowing the public to organize around corruption concerns, especially as the public might be inclined to seize the oppor- tunities with ferocity as they have in decades-past anti-cor- ruption mass campaigns (Li, 2001). Yet, even beyond this are diﬃculties particular to the rule of mandates environ- ment. First, the public does not generally know the man- dates that local oﬃcials are given, so they have no way to judge how conscientiously an oﬃcial met the mandates. So, while higher oﬃcials may wish to collect the information that locals have on local conditions—through welcoming and recording complaints for instance—they have no reason to expect that the public, politically excluded as it is, could distinguish between mandate-driven and corruption-driven behavior by oﬃcials who fail to implement laws. Second, if the public were told the particulars of the mandates, many might object to the priorities implicit in them, exacerbating the party’s diﬃculties. Indeed, the public’s own policy prior- ities are diverse and often diﬀer from the priorities in the mandates. For instance, while the central mandates most strongly prioritize order and economic growth, 51% of respondents thought that rights protections should be among any society’s top two priorities, and 24% thought that public participation should be. Another policy solution that could make it easier to monitor local oﬃcials would be to give them less discretion in deciding how to pursue their mandates. Indeed, corruption control measures often emphasize the need to limit the discretion given to lower oﬃcials. Of course, such a policy would be diﬃcult for China to implement because it undermines a crucial fea- ture of the rule of mandates paradigm, which is that lower oﬃ- cials must have the ﬂexibility to adjust which laws and policies they follow in order to focus on the highest priority outcomes. This paradigm has beneﬁts for the Chinese regime that it may be loathe to part with in the short term. For one, it helps the regime to achieve high priority outcomes without central oﬃ- cials having to understand speciﬁc local areas of the country. Second, as I have argued elsewhere, it stabilizes the regime in the short run by preventing the unwanted spillover eﬀects of policies like village elections. In the long run, however, if the system consistently faces overwhelming information challenges in detecting corrup- tion—as I have suggested in this paper—the rule of mandates may undermine China’s long-term prospects. In the end, the policies that are needed to greatly reduce corruption in China may not be neutral or quick ﬁxes. Rather they may need to be fundamentally related to political reform, not only in terms of methods of choosing and overseeing oﬃcials, but also in terms of whether oﬃcials are held to absolute or relative standards. Further research is needed to determine empirically how much corruption is sheltered by a rule of mandates system, to mea- sure the extent of any development beneﬁts or costs of a rule of mandates, and to assess the extent to which various reforms might help ﬁght corruption. Yet, I hope that this study has laid out clear reasons to believe that a rule of mandates system helps to veil oﬃcial corruption. REFERENCES Alpermann, B. (2003).

APPENDIX A The Village Democracy Survey in Shandong and Henan was implemented in three stages, beginning in November 2005, as a collaborative eﬀort with the Research Center on Contempo- rary China at Peking University, Pierre Landry, and Shiru Wang. Stage One was an in-person survey of a random sample of individuals in Shandong and Henan. These individuals were selected through a geographic sampling technique that pro- ceeded as follows: within each of the provinces (Shandong and Henan), seven counties were selected at random according to a population-density weighting scheme that made it more likely that densely populated counties would be selected. With- in each county, a township was selected at random, again according to a population-density weighting scheme. Within each township, two geographic squares, delineated by GPS measurements, were randomly selected; and the dwellings within those squares were enumerated. In practice, the 28 geo- graphic squares, 14 in each province, encompassed 26 villages, 13 in each province. This is because, in two townships, both of the selected geographic squares randomly happened to fall within the same large village. Within each of the dwellings in- cluded in the ﬁnal sample, one resident was randomly chosen to be interviewed. Because the interviews were conducted in person and multiple attempts were made to contact each indi- vidual, the overall response rate to the survey is quite high, at about 65%. One township was resurveyed in November 2006, as some rural respondents had originally been inadvertently administered an urban version of the survey. In Stage Two, qualitative interviews were conducted of the Village Committee Chairs (Village Heads) and Village Party Secretaries of the administrative villages included in the sur- vey. Shiru Wang conducted these personally in November and December 2005. Knowledgeable residents were also inter- viewed about village facts and local politics, by the team lead- ers and enumerators in charge of the individual level survey. Information from these additional interviews provides a qual- itative supplement to the leadership interviews. In Stage Three, which took place in November 2006, all of the townships in the sample were re-visited; and a survey was administered to a senior township leader with the respon- sibility for overseeing village elections. At the same time, de- tailed election histories were collected on all the villages in the sample, through township and village oﬃcial records where available, along with interviewing of local oﬃcials. (a) Individual-level survey questions used to measure village election implementation The following measures were used to assess the quality of the latest Village Committee election. These measures were constructed from the responses to individuals’ survey ques- tions, speciﬁed below, or from information from qualitative interviews, as noted. (i) Latest election—contestation Qualitative information from leadership interviews was used. (ii) Latest election—enfranchisement Responses to the following questions were used, in combina- tion, to determine the percentage of villagers, by village, who believed they were welcome to vote in the election. C4: Have you ever voted in a Village Committee election? C4a: Why haven’t you voted? Is it because you don’t have the right to vote, or for another reason? (open-ended responses noted) C10: Did you vote in the last village election? C10a: Why didn’t you vote in the last village election? (open-ended responses noted) (iii) Latest election—nomination openness C11: In the last election, could you directly nominate a candidate? (b) Survey questions used to measure township intervention Township checkpoints for intervening in village elections (asked of township oﬃcial in charge of election oversight). A count index (0, 1,2, 3) was created to represent the num- ber of checkpoints revealed in response to the questions below.

       "[{'introduction': 'In democratic national elections an individual vote matters only in highly unlikely situations. It can be said that it is more likely to win the jackpot of the German state lottery than to become once the decisive voter in a lifetime or to be hit in a thunderstorm than to change the voting results. Here we do not want to engage in a discussion of how one compares two such unlikely events. In our view, it is an obvious and therefore an accepted fact that individual voters almost surely cannot alter an election result regardless of whether they vote or not and how they vote. In public choice theory it is assumedthat individuals as voters act rationally, i.e., by their voting behavior they try to maximise their own beneﬁts. Given the fact that voting means to invest some effort (gathering and evaluating information, going to the polling booth or requesting an absentee ballot for postal vote), the extremely low probability of one’s own vote being decisive makes voting apparently irrational. Because of this conclusion it is often asked why people vote, and one tries to give reasons. Our emphasis in this paper is not to discuss these arguments theoretically, but to address the problem directly by attempting to measure the values which people assign to their voting rights. More specifically, we report on an experiment undertaken before the national election of the German Bundestag in 1994 in which participants had the opportunity to sell their voting rights for possibly substantial amounts. One usually requires replicability in experimental research. Although one no longer can sell the voting right for the election in 1994, analoguous studies could be performed for any election with given voting rights. Since the experiment was based on an incentive compatible mechanism (Becker, de Groot and Marshak, 1963), the price bid attained can be interpreted as the true (willingness-to-accept) value for one’s voting right. Usually the willingness-to-pay value is strictly smaller than the willingness-to-accept value (R¨omer, 1991). This is mostly attributed to an endowment effect which, however, would be difficult to detect in our experiment. Using a follow-up (postexperimental) questionnaire asking for reasons to vote and not to vote in addition to some personal characteristics, it is possible to assess the importance of the various reasons for why people vote or not and compare these to the individual values for being able to vote. The results are striking: Most of our participants did not want to sell their voting right even at the top price of DM 200 (German marks) which had been offered. Only a surprisingly small minority of participants (2.8%) would have sold their voting right for any positive price. That is, only very few people view their individual voting power as inessential as suggested by the “why do people vote?” paradox. Another intermediate group (of about one quarter of our 174 participants) was willing to sell their voting right for substantial prices, but refused to do so at very low prices. In our view, such results can be used to explain the different participation rates in different elections if one interprets non-willingness to sell one’s voting right as willingness to vote. There is a small group of voters who hardly ever vote since they consider it to be inessential or worthless. Others only vote when the opportunity costs of voting are not prohibitive or if the election results are especially interesting like the outcome of some sports events. The majority of voters, however, considers it as their (moral) duty to participate in democratic elections. The answers of the postexperimental questionnaire provide further clues as to why most voters decide to vote and never consider not to vote. Voters who care about their voting right although their vote is very unlikely to matter must view voting in democratic elections as a moral duty and/or attribute some intrinsic value to democratic voting acts. They do not behave',\n",

       " {'introduction': 'Distributional consequences are associated with political extremism, both in the short run and in the long run. Extreme political parties often propose to redistribute resources away from specific subgroups of society, such as the rich, ethnic minorities, or citizens living in specific regions. This paper analyzes the impact of economic growth on the support for extreme political parties in western democracies. We argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income, affects the support for extremism. In the first part of our paper, we discuss three alternative explanations for why an increase in the economic growth rate reduces the support for extreme political parties. Two well-known explanations are related to retrospective voting and behavioral effects, the latter meaning that voters may react more strongly to changes in than to levels of economic well-being. The third, novel explanation is that parties with extreme political platforms are perceived to create considerable uncertainty about the future distribution of income. We develop a simple game-theoretic model that analyzes that uncertainty effect. In our model, extreme political parties offer short-run gains from redistribution to a group of individuals. However, the same individuals also face long-run losses owing to the higher income risk that is associated with an extreme regime. The model permits a comparative static analysis with respect to several key variables of interest. The growth rate is associated with larger future income risk. Such risk reduces the number of voters favoring extreme parties. The level of aggregate income has no effect on the support for extremism. Income inequality raises support for redistribution and affects the impact that a change in the growth rate has on the support for extremism. An important feature of our model is that the effect of economic growth on the support for extremism depends on uncertainty of future income redistribution. If redistributive policies are perceived as predictable—in the sense that the same group will have income taken away from it in the future—then the political support for an extremist party is unaffected by growth. In the empirical part of our paper, we estimate the relationship between economic growth and the support for extreme political parties using a panel dataset comprising 16 European countries. Our dependent variable is a survey-based measure, compiled by Eurobarometer, of respondents’ support for extreme right-wing parties and extreme left-wing parties. We use that data, which spans more than three decades and contains entries on a semi-annual frequency, to estimate the effects of economic growth on the support for extremism. Our empirical analysis shows a significant negative effect of real per capita GDP growth on the support for extreme right-wing parties: controlling for country and time fixed effects, a one percentage point decline in real per capita GDP growth increases the vote share of extreme right-wing parties by up to one percentage point. We document that the negative effect of economic growth on the support for right-wing extremism is robust across estimation techniques and model specifications. We do not find a systematic effect of growth on the support for left-wing extremism. A possible explanation for the differential effects between left-wing and right-wing extremism that relates closely to our theoretical model is that right-wing extremism might be associated with more uncertainty over what groups will be subject to income expropriation in the future. Left-wing extremism is associated with income redistribution, but little uncertainty exists over its target. Communist doctrine (see, for example, the Communist Manifesto by Marx and Engels 1848), envisions a classless society; i.e., a society wherein incomes are distributed equally. Over the past century, extreme left-wing parties have followed closely that doctrine by proposing to redistribute incomes from rich to poor; as opposition parties they have voted against laissez faire policies and, when in power, they have implemented programs that reduced the wealth and income prospects of the rich (see, e.g., Brown 2010). Our theoretical model concentrates on purely economic motives and does not consider other, in particular, social motives of political choices that have been discussed in the literature (see, e.g., Lipset 1967; Corneo and Grüner 2000). Our analysis applies to democratic countries, i.e., countries in which exists political competition exists. In that context, we call a political platform extreme if it proposes major redistributions of resources when compared to standard policies. See, for related theoretical analysis, Artale and Grüner (2000).',\n",

       " {'introduction': 'Decisions taken via democratic vote are often considered to yield more moral outcomes | than individual decisions, in particular when it comes to choices made in a market context. | This dichotomy between “electoral choice” and “market choice” (Brennan & Lomasky, | 1993 ) is based on a compelling argument: According to the “low-cost theory of voting” | (Tyran et xa0al.,  2019 ), instrumental considerations decrease with pivotality, i.e., the number | of voters involved, while the utility from expressing moral principles remains unaffected by | the size of the constituency. Thus, with decreasing probability of being pivotal, the ultimate | decision is more likely to favor the more moral option (Brennan & Buchanan,  1984 ; Fio-| rina,  1976 ; Tullock,  1971 ). In market decisions, in contrast, the potential conflicts between | instrumental and expressive motives seem to be often resolved in favor of the former, lead-| ing to more self-serving, less moral behavior. Recent experimental evidence seems to sup-| port this conjecture (Bartling et xa0al.,  2014 ; Falk & Szech,  2013 ; Falk et xa0al.,  2020 ).| From the outset, this dichotomy has been explained by the notion of decision-makers | having to “reduce internal dissonance” (Tullock  1971 , xa0p. 387) between their moral prefer-| ences and payoff-oriented self-interest. This goes back to the theory of cognitive disso-| nance, first derived in Festinger ( 1957 ), which establishes different individual strategies to | resolve such internal conflicts. For example, in xa0situations where moral views and self-inter-| est are in conflict, the individual can resolve this conflict by deciding in favor of either one | option or the other. In the context of the low-cost theory of voting, the small probability of | being pivotal alters this trade-off in favor of expressing moral principles, leading to more | moral decisions.| Another strategy to reduce cognitive dissonance is to not use all available informa-| tion on the consequences of a decision, even if information is accessible without cost. As | was first pointed out by Festinger ( 1957 ), people tend to avoid information that might be | incongruent with their established attitudes while disproportionately seeking news that | is congruent—a tendency that is referred to as selective exposure to information.',\n",
