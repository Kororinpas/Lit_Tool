Empirical results show that both indicators affect the promotion of Chinese mayors, while such impacts vary across regions. We also ﬁnd that there are heterogeneous results across pollution types. The main results hold for pollution that can be detected easily by the public. In contrast, less eye-catching pollution do not block a mayor from promotion signiﬁcantly. Public opinions do exert pressures toward mayors' promotion. However, when considering the mayors' personal characteristics, the performance assessment mechanism is no longer remarkable, which demonstrates that the promotion of a Chinese administrative ofﬁcial depends more heavily on his political resume. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. 1. Introduction In last three decades, the continued rapid growth in China, known as “China miracle” astonishes the world. Since promotion impact fueled the local ofﬁcials' enthusiasts of economic develop- ment, it usually has been treated as an important factor for China's economic growth as the opening reform. For most Chinese local ofﬁcials, they often will stay one term (typically ﬁve years) or two terms(usually tenyears) fortheircurrentposition, then beevaluated by a formal evaluation system (kaohe zhidu) to decide whether they will promote or not (Whiting and Susan, 2004). This assessment mechanism transformed from mainly political achievements into primarilyeconomic growth since the 1980s. To explain the behaviors for Chinese local ofﬁcials under such evaluation system, “promotion tournament mechanism”– which meant in China's political system, when higher human-resource-management ofﬁcials evaluating, appointing and dismissing subordinate ofﬁcials, economic performance was the most important factor taken into account (Li and Zhou, 2005) e had been widely accept as a research format. Although “promotion tournament” could help regional eco- nomic growth, but its negative impact, especially in environmental aspect, cannot be ignored (Jiao et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2014). For example, promotion tournament made ofﬁcials only care about local economic growth during their tenure while ignoring the accompanying environmental problems (Zhou, 2007). Some research also argued that government ofﬁcials might seek their interests which could be against residents' will, such as lowering environmental standards to attract high-polluting enterprises’ in- vestment (Qian and Roland, 1998). As a result, the rapid economic growth had stimulated an increasing regional pollution (Song et al., 2015; Du et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2016; Xie et al., 2017). Facing such pollution challenge, the Chinese central government made a response. In 2005, the State Council issued “On the Concept of Scientiﬁc Development and Strengthening Environmental Pro- tection,” which proposed to put environmental protection into the evaluation of local governors and regarded it as an assessment basis of governors’ selection, appointment, rewards, and punishments. In 2007, the State Council issued “Circular of the State Council on the Issuance of the Comprehensive Work Plan for Energy Saving and * Corresponding author.

       " Document(page_content='Emission Reduction”. This program directly pointed out that the target of energy conservation and emission reduction should be an important part of the comprehensive assessment of the government leading cadres, and planned to implement “one-vote negation sys- tem”. Recently, the report of the 18th CPC National Congress pro- posed the overall layout of the \"ﬁve in one”, emphasized the importance of the construction of ecological civilization, and clearly pointed out that “put resource consumption, environmental dam- age and environmental beneﬁts into the economic and social development evaluation system, establish a target system including assessment methods, rewards and punishments mechanism which embodied ecological civilization requirements”. However, whether the concentration for environmental issues has the impact on policy makers\\' careers or behaviors is still in a debate. Some researchers argued that the environmental quality had little or no impact on politicians\\' career (Guber, 2001; Vandeweerdt et al.,2016),whileothers believedthatenvironmentalissues affected politicians’ career (Davis and Wurth, 2003) or their decision-making behaviors (Nelson, 2002; Mohai and Kershner, 2002; Ard, 2011). For China, although there were a lot of researchers discussed the rela- tionship between environmental policy and economic growth (e.g., Chen, et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013), rare research had brought this question for Chinese political promotion system. Therefore, this paper extends the “promotion tournament” modeled (Zhou, 2004), combined with a panel dataset of “Top 100 economic performed cities” in China from 2003 to 2012, tries to answer the above question that for modern China, whether the environmental protection requirement impacts local ofﬁcials po- litical career. The rest of this article organized as follows. Section 1 presents the theoretical model and discusses our empirical hy- potheses. Section 2 describes the empirical method and data used. Section 3 presents the empirical results and Section 4 concludes. 2. Theoretical model 2.1. 1Research objects For theoretical model, we focused on city level ofﬁcials\\' behav- iors in China. In a town, the core government team composed of the city Chinese Communist Party (CCP) committee group led by the party secretary and the municipal government group led by the mayor. Among this team, a high-level city ofﬁcer is usually appointed by the local CCP secretary, but the local government group executes issues such as urban development planning, capital use scheduling and other government decision-making. In spite of the fact that the relevant managerial powers dispersed among the vice-mayors, a Chinese city mayor has the ﬁnal decision-making authority over all matters within the city limits. In other words, the mayors of China\\'s cities, have the largest \"free decision power.” Since such power constrained by urban areas, the mayors of Chi- nese cities deﬁned as the research objects in this study. 2.2. Model setup In this research, we construct a game model to investigate the promotion competition of a Chinese mayor.1 We follow Zhou (2004)’s framework of “promotion tournament” for Chinese ofﬁ- cials, extends the competition model originally from Lazear and Rosen (1981) with extra consideration about environment protec- tion and public environmental concern. We assume that individual efforts cannot be observed, and the performance evaluation of the promotion of the region will be represented by a comprehensive evaluation indicator yi. Thus, un- der the new promotion evaluation with the dual goal of economic growth and environment protection in China, we assume ai as one mayor\\'s economic performance effort, and bi as environment pro- tection effort. From previous study, Yu et al. (2014) used the GDP growth rate to measure the promotion expectation of local gover- nors, and he discovered that there was a signiﬁcantly negative relationship between local environmental pollution incidents and economic losses. Follow this idea, we assume there is a functional relationship between environmental protection and economic performance, as. bi ¼ GðaiÞ; and G 0 < 0 Thus, in the two mayors’ promotion competition model, per- formance could be observed by: yi ¼ ai þ maj þ sGðaiÞ þ ei (1) yj ¼ aj þ mai þ sG�aj � þ ej (2) In the above equations,s is the environmental pollution reaction factor, which captures the attention of public caused by environ- mental pollution.2 Pollution that can be easily detected is more likely to be discussed by the public. Thus, s > 0 ai is the economic performance of mayor i, m is the spillover effect factor from mayor i\\'s economic performance to mayor j. eI is the random disturbance term. eI and ej are independent from each other, and we assume ðej � eiÞ follows an independent and identical symmetric distri- bution, with an expectation equals 0. Under such performance, mayor i\\'s promotion possibility func- tion can be written as: Pr � yi �yj >0 � ¼ Pr �ð1�mÞ�ai �aj �þs�GðaiÞ�G�aj �� þ�ei �ej �>0� ¼ Pr ��ej �ei �<ð1�mÞ�ai �aj �þs�GðaiÞ�G�aj ��� ¼ F�ð1�mÞ�ai �aj �þs�GðaiÞ�G�aj ��� (3) At this moment, mayor i\\'s utility function is: UðaiÞ ¼ V � F�ð1 � mÞ�ai � aj � þ s�GðaiÞ � G�aj ���þ v � �1 � F�ð1 � mÞ�ai � aj � þ s�GðaiÞ � G�aj ���� � CðaiÞ (4) where V is the utility that mayor i been promoted, v is the utility for mayor i that mayor j had not been promoted. Both V and v are not correlated to ai. CðaiÞ is the cost for mayor i\\'s effort. And the ﬁrst order condition to maximize mayor i\\'s utility will be: vU vai ¼ V�f�ð1�mÞ�ai �aj �þs�GðaiÞ�G�aj ���� � ð1�mÞþsG 0ðaiÞ � þv���f�ð1�mÞ�ai�aj �þs�GðaiÞ�G�aj ����� � ð1�mÞ þsG 0ðaiÞ � � C 0ðaiÞ¼0 (5) As: 1 Like Lazear and Rosen (1981) and Zhou (2004), our model also could be used to describe the competition between two government departments or competition between two branches of one company. 2 The concern about apparent pollution will be higher than inapparent one. For example, both are air pollution, the increase of industry soot is easier to be sensed by public than the increase of O3. Thus, people will have stronger reaction to in- dustry soot pollution than O3 pollution. Z. Pu, J.

Under symmetry Nash equilibrium, the above ﬁrst order condition could be re-written as: ðV � vÞ�f½0�� � ð1 � mÞ þ sG 0� ¼ C 0ðaiÞ (7) Then we can ﬁnd that under “promotion tournament”, a mayor does not prefer other competitors to “copy” his economic perfor- mance e since this might decrease the chance for his own pro- motion. As for environmental control, since G 0 < 0 the mayor will prefer approaches to 0, reducing the reverse effect to one's pro- motion by public attention caused by environmental pollution. According to such theoretical analyses, we propose the following three hypotheses for empirical tests. Hypothesis 1. According to the analyses above, we bring “envi- ronmental performance” into “the promotion tournament,” and pose that besides the economic performance, the environmental performance affects the chance of promotion for a mayor in China. Hypothesis 2. People's responses are always instant and intense toward that observable and visible pollution, such as water pollu- tion in lakes, haze, and others, while their responses are slow to- ward some solid waste discharge, such as garbage dumps. Thus, we assume that pollution which relatively not easy to be sensed will not limit a mayor's promotion in China. In contrast, eye catching pollution will signiﬁcantly block a mayor from the promotion. Hypothesis 3. With the popularization of the Internet, the regional social issues have quickly evolved into hot topics with national attention, and further formed signiﬁcant pressures toward both local and central governments. For example, Zheng et al. (2013) searched a number of the key words “newspaper þ environmental pollution” in the google search as the coverage of local media about environmental contamination. The results showed that the public concern could indeed improve the environmental control and investment of local governments. Song and Guan (2015) also found that the greater the public participa- tion, the better the appraisals of government service quality. Therefore, we pose that public opinions brought by new media have a social ampliﬁcation effect which will affect the chance of promotion for a mayor in China. 3. Empirical model and data selection This research conducts an empirical analysis to test the possible inﬂuences of economic performance and local environmental state on the probability of a China mayor's promotion suggested in the previous section. In other words, we investigate whether the new appraisal mechanism directing at local ofﬁcials can play a role. 3.1. Speciﬁcation of promotion investigation model Considering both new and old evaluation mechanism of a China mayor's promotion, pressures from the public opinions, and a China mayor's biological and political features, we construct the following empirical model: prit ¼ b0 þ b1Xit þ b2Yit þ b3Zit þ b4Controlsit þ εit (8) In this model, prit stands for whether the mayor will get promoted in the next year, Xit is the macroeconomic information vector, made up of per capita gross domestic product, scalable in- dustrial gross value and per capita disposable income of urban citizens respectively. Yit is the environmental information vector, including three indices – the discharge volume of industrial waste water, the industrial emission and the industrial soot emission. Zit is the online public opinion information vector, composed of school enrollment in higher education institutes and international internet users. Controlsit stands for a series of political features probably inﬂuencing a mayor’ grown-up, covering whether the mayor worked in the province of his native place and whether he got promoted in the same place. i and t mean city and year respectively, εit is the random disturbance. We use panel data analysis with cluster-robust standard error. 3.2. Regional division In this study, top 100 economic preformed cities of China from 2003 to 2012 are selected. The names are listed in Table 1 and the location is shown as colored part in Fig. 1. As in the ﬁgure, although the geographical areas of these cities do not cover majority of China, their contribution to the economy and environmental pollution are more than 80% over the entire country. Therefore, these cities in our sample as research objects would represent the situation in China sufﬁciently. These 100 cities were divided into six regions based on geographic and economic facts. The regional division codes used is shown in Table 2, and the region-code relation can be referred solely from Fig. 2. This manner of regional division is based not only on geography, but also on economics. The six divided regions have distinct eco- nomic characteristics. Three coastal areas e the northern coastal and northeastern areas, the eastern coastal areas and the southern coastal areas are the traditional “wealthy part” of China, which have different development styles: the northern coastal and northeastern areas rely more on heavy industry, while other two coastal areas are more light industry and foreign trade oriented. The middle reaches of Yangtze River and the middle reaches of the Yellow River are usually known as the middle part of China. Considering the cities around the Yangtze River are usually richer than the cities around the Yellow River, in this study, we divide them into two different areas. For the last part, the southwestern and northwestern areas are the west part of China which is the least developed areas in the whole nation. 3.3. Variables selection and data sources Given the data, especially the availability of characteristics data of the city administrative ofﬁcials, this paper demonstrates the mayors' information, city's main economic information, environ- mental information and the popularity of the Internet of 99 cities covering the “Top 100 Cities” except Sanya from 2003 to 2012 and other relevant data. Apart from data availability, the period from 2003 to 2012 was a decade when the Chinese economy had increased the most explosively, when the environmental pollution problem had appeared the most frequently and when the Chinese central government declared the change of ofﬁcial promotion appraisal system. The major economic data include per capita gross domestic product, scalable industrial total value and per capita disposable income of urban citizens. These data come from each statistical yearbook of Chinese cities (China City Statistical Year Book 2004 to 2013)and DRC net database, in which per capita gross domestic product and per capita, the disposable income of urban citizens are variables reﬂecting the cities' economic devel- opment level. We can naturally ﬁnd out that in the original Z. Pu, J.

       " Document(page_content=\"incentive mechanism, the more outstanding the mayor's economic achievement was, the more likely he would get promoted. Hence, we anticipate that the two indices have a naturally positive corre- lation with the promotion. The scalable industrial gross value does not only reﬂect the economic development level but also indirectly reﬂects the environmental pollution level – the greater the total industrial value is, the more severe byproduct and the environ- mental pollution there will be. Therefore, the sign of the coefﬁcient is uncertain. The environmental variables involve the discharge volume of industrial waste water, the industrial emission, and the industrial soot emission. All these environmental pollution data can be ob- tained from the statistical yearbook of the Chinese city and DRC net database. We expect the coefﬁcients all to be negative, which means the terrible environmental performance would hurt the mayor's promotion. But due to people's different perception of various pollutants, we can further believe that compared with the industrial pollutant SO2, which is unable to be perceived directly, the negative inﬂuence of the industrial waste water and soot emission are more prominent. This paper uses school enrollment in higher education institutes and international internet users as instrumental variables to depict the online public opinion pressures. The data comes from the sta- tistical yearbook of each city. Generally speaking, the higher educational level residents are at, the more attention they pay to Table 1 City names.

       " Document(page_content=\"social problems, the more frequently they surf the Internet. Meanwhile, the popularity of the Internet has made it possible that the public can access to various news at the fastest speed and publish their attitudes. Based on the above analyses, this paper holds that in an area, the more education the public receive, and the more international internet users there are, the more active the public of this area will be in issuing opinions online. This will exert pressures on the political future of local ofﬁcials, thus causing the coefﬁcient to be negative. Finally, the biological and political characteristics of Chinese mayors will also have impacts on whether they can get promoted.3 This paper considers whether mayors take ofﬁce/govern in their birthplaces and whether they have been promoted previously as two indices to present mayors' characteristics.4 It is necessary to state that due to lack of ofﬁcial statistics on city administration ofﬁcials' information and updated data, the above data concerning mayors’ personal biological and political characteristics as well as some relevant information are collected manually by the authors. The chosen variables in this paper depicted in Table 3. The descriptive statistics for all variables could found in Table 4, which included all explanatory variables from Table 3, and independent variable “promotion” (see Table 5). The political destiny of a Chinese mayor can be divided into four types – terminations, transference to the same level, promotion, and death. As for the particular division, this paper mainly refers to He and Sun (2012) way of classiﬁcation, as is shown in Table 2, but with termination and death combined, therefore only three choices listed in Table 4. Since the management of promotion is directly controlled by the central government in many cities, this paper adopts the “judge-one-by-one” way to deal with the advancement of some particular persons.5 4. Empirical results Using the empirical model and data from chapter 2, this paper will ﬁrst take entire sample of 99 cities to analyze whether the mayor promotion mechanism applies to the entire country. 4.1. Investigation of the general impact In the general impact model, this paper focuses on the effects of environmental pollution on promotion, and probes into apparent and inapparent pollutants respectively. The empirical results are shown in Table 6. For all the result tables, there were four models used for each pollutant (area). Model 1 only includes macroeco- nomic information vector, environmental information vector, on- line public opinion information vector and control vector are added into test from model 2 to model 4 step by step. The test result shown that per capita GDP has a negative but not signiﬁcant effect on the promotion across all regressions. The scalable industrial gross value is negative in the majority of models. On the contrary, the per capita disposable income of urban citizens is always playing a part in facilitating the promotion, which means that the higher per capita disposable income urban residents can obtain, the more likely the local ofﬁcials will get promoted. As for pollution, the industrial waste water acts as an obstruc- tion to promotion, especially in model 2 and 3, manifesting as negative at 5% and 10% signiﬁcant level. However, it is uncertain about the coefﬁcient of the industrial SO2 emission since it has an indistinctive positive effect in model 2 and 3, but an adverse effect in model 4. The industrial soot emission has an accelerating inﬂu- ence on the promotion, with an unexpected 5% level of signiﬁcance in both model 2 and 3. As for public concern, it is worth noting that in model 3, both the school enrollment in higher education institutes and the interna- tional internet users have remarkable negative impacts on pro- motion. In other words, with the increase in school enrollment and netizens, the probability of the mayor's promotion will decline. However, after adding control variables, covering whether the mayor worked in the province of his native place and whether he got promoted in the same location, the public opinion indicators become positive, but less impact and insigniﬁcant. Taking ofﬁce in the birthplace has an adverse effect at the 5% level of signiﬁcance, namely if the mayor takes ofﬁce in his hometown, it will be a lower probability for him to get promoted. By contrast, the variable of whether getting promoted in the same place has a prominent positive inﬂuence on a mayor's promotion at the 1% level of signiﬁcance. 4.2.

This kind of promotion is regarded as a compensation which can help them improve retirement beneﬁts in a short term. 4 Since ancient times, China had adopted the Birthplace-Avoiding System in the civil ofﬁcial promotion (The person who was born in one place are forbidden to be the chief executive ofﬁce in this place), thus the birthplace of an ofﬁcial also be- comes an important reference to whether he/she can be promoted. But in recent years, the situation had been slightly changed. 5 Most data for this study come from open database. If any reader is interested for such data, he is welcomed for asking.

       " Document(page_content=\"Tables 7 and 8 have shown the estimated results about water pollution of six areas, which are signiﬁcantly different from the result for the whole country. The economic indicator of the per capita GDP of the northern coastal and northeastern areas has hindering effects on promotion in all models. The per capita GDP of the eastern coastal regions takes an adverse effect only in model 1 and makes contributions to the mayor's promotion after adding environmental variables, public concern variables, and control variables in turn in model 2, 3, and 4, though being insigniﬁcant. The per capita GDP of the middle reaches of the Yellow River; the southwestern and northwestern areas are both unhelpful to promotion in model 1, 2 and 3. But after introducing the mayors' characteristics, it reverses as an inapparent negative impact. On the contrary, the per capita GDP of the middle reaches of the Yangtze River are helpful to promotion in model 1, 2, and 3, but the impact changes to the opposite after adding the mayors' char- acteristics. The per capita GDP of the southern coastal areas is sig- niﬁcant positive to the possibility of promotion, which is different from that of the national level and other districts. Concerning scalable industrial gross value (SIGV), the co- efﬁcients of the southwestern and northwestern areas are negative in model 1, 2 and 4 but positive in model 3. The northern coastal and northeastern areas and the eastern coastal areas have similar char- acteristics that the coefﬁcients of scalable industrial gross value are negative and indistinctive, indicating that higher scalable industrial gross value will to some degree go against the promotion. The middle reaches of the Yellow River leads to the opposite results. The southern coastal areas are the same with the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. The coefﬁcients of the scalable industrial gross value are positive until considering the mayors’ characteristics. Once taken into account, the higher scalable industrial gross value will lessen the probability of promotion. In the northern coastal and northeastern areas, the eastern coastal regions and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the inﬂuence of the per capita disposable income of urban citizens are similar. The higher the per capita disposable income of urban citizens are, the more likely the mayor will get promoted. It is opposite to the southwestern and northwestern areas case where higher per capita disposable income goes against political promotion for mayors. The middle reaches of the Yellow River are the same as the southwestern and northwestern areas from model 1 to 3, but after introducing the mayors' characteristics, it turns out to an inapparent positive effect. In the southern coastal areas, the per capita disposable income of urban citizens has non-signiﬁcant positive results from model 1 to 3. After introducing the mayors’ characteristics, the effect becomes Table 5 Political destiny of the mayors.

From the perspective of apparent pollutants, in the northern coastal and northeastern areas, and the eastern coastal areas, the coefﬁcients of wastewater are negative in model 2 and 3, but after adding the mayors' characteristics, the coefﬁcient changes into positive. In the southwestern and northwestern areas, the coefﬁcient is positive in model 2 and 3 but reverses after adding the mayors' characteristics. In the southern coastal areas, the coefﬁcient of wastewater is negative, which means that the more industrial waste water discharge there is, the less satisﬁed the mayor's po- litical future will be. However, the cases in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River and the middle reaches of the Yellow River are just the opposite, there exist inapparent positive inﬂuences in all models, which means in these areas, the more industrial waste water discharge there is, the more likely the mayor is to get promoted. As for pressures from online public opinions, the coefﬁcients of school enrollment in general institutes of higher education are negative in most districts except the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in model 3. After taking the mayors' characteristics into ac- count in model 4, the coefﬁcients in the northern coastal and northeastern areas and the southwestern and northwestern areas become positive, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River changes into negative. And the coefﬁcients of international internet users are positive in the northern coastal and northeastern areas and the southern coastal areas, but negative in other areas in model 3. After considering the mayors’ characteristics in model 4, the coefﬁcients change into positive in most districts except the northern coastal and northeastern areas. It is noteworthy that the two indicators of the mayors' features have signiﬁcant inﬂuences in the mayors' promotion. Whether taking ofﬁce in their birthplaces has an adverse impact on a mayor's promotion in most districts except the southwestern and north- western areas, while getting promoted in the same place has a signiﬁcant positive impact on a mayor's promotion, which is consistent with the national level. 4.3. Inapparent pollutants and the promotion of mayors Tables 9 and 10 have reﬂected the effect that the inapparent pollutant (industrial emission) has on a China mayor's promotion, which is quite different from the situation of the whole country. In the aspect of the economic indicator “per capita GDP,” there is an adverse effect on promotion in the northern coastal and north- eastern areas, the eastern coastal areas and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River in model 1 to 3. After adding the mayors' features, the coefﬁcient of the northern coastal and northeastern areas keeps negative, while the coefﬁcients of the eastern coastal regions and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River turn to be positive. Except for model 1, the coefﬁcients of “per capita GDP” in the middle reaches of the Yellow River have negative impacts on a mayor's promotion. While the same indicator in the southwestern and northwestern areas has a negative impact only in model 4, which is opposite to that in the southern coastal areas. The coefﬁcients of “per capita GDP” in the southern coastal areas keep positive in all models, which means that in the southern coastal areas, the higher the “per capita GDP,” the greater the possibility of a mayor's promotion will be. The coefﬁcients of “per capita GDP” in the southwestern and north- western areas are also positive in model 1 to 3, but after introducing the mayors' features, the impact reverses. Comparing with apparent pollutants, the impacts of “scalable industrial gross value” and “per capita disposable income of urban citizens” on a mayor's promotion keep robust when we consider the inapparent pollutants. Regarding the inapparent pollutants, the industrial SO2 emis- sion in the eastern coastal areas has an inapparent positive effect on Table 9 The estimated results of the relation between SO2 and the mayors’ promotion in three districts.

       " Document(page_content=\"mayors' promotion in model 2 and 3, but a hindering effect on promotion in model 4. In the northern coastal and northeastern areas and the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the greater the industrial SO2 emission is, the easier it is for mayors in these two areas to get promoted, especially in model 4 where the industrial emission has a 5% and 10% level of signiﬁcance in these two areas respectively. The coefﬁcients of industrial SO2 emission in the southern coastal areas are negative in model 2 and 3, but it turns to be non- signiﬁcantly positive after adding the mayors' features. The coefﬁ- cient of industrial SO2 emission in the southwestern and north- western areas is negative in model 2 but changes into positive after adding the public concern indicators and the mayors' personal features in turn. The inﬂuences of industrial SO2 emission on a mayor's promotion keep negative in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River for all the models, which means that in this area, the greater the industrial SO2 emission is, less likely the ofﬁcials are to be promoted. From the perspective of pressures from online public opinions, the coefﬁcients of school enrollment in general institutes of higher education are negative in most districts except that the coefﬁcient of the northern coastal and northeastern areas turns to be positive after adding the mayors' features. The international internet users in the eastern coastal areas, the middle reaches of the Yellow River, the southern coastal areas and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have positive impacts on the mayors' promotion, though not so prominent. The coefﬁcient in the northern coastal and northeastern areas changes into negative after considering the mayors’ features, while the coefﬁcient in the southwestern and northwestern areas changes into positive. It is not hard to ﬁnd that the two indicators of mayors' personal features show similar inﬂuences as the whole country (except for being indistinctively positive in the southwestern and northwestern areas), which means that no matter how the pollution situation is, it will be more difﬁcult for a mayor to be promoted from one's hometown but easier to be promoted if he worked in a non- hometown province that once got promoted. 4.4. Further inspection based on inapparent pollutants Compared with the former two pollutants, the industrial soot has a higher probability of being naturally removed that it is less severe than the sensible pollutants. However, on airtight condi- tions, the particle contaminants contained with industrial soot will form fog and haze in partial areas, thus can be sensed by the public immediately. The industrial soot can be regarded as an unremark- able efﬂuent to be investigated. Tables 10 and 11 present the results (see Table 12). Comparing with industrial SO2 emission, the impacts of eco- nomic indicators “per capita GDP,” “scalable industrial gross value” and “per capita disposable income of urban citizens” on a mayor's promotion almost keep robust when we consider the impacts of industrial soot emission. However, the coefﬁcients of “scalable in- dustrial gross value” and “per capita disposable income of urban citizens” in the southern coastal areas are positive in model 1, but turn to be negative after adding the environmental indicators, the public concern indicators and the mayors' characteristics one by one.

       " Document(page_content=\"and the southern coast areas, the greater the industrial soot emis- sion is, the easier it is for mayors in these regions to get promoted, especially in model 4 where the industrial soot emission has a 5% level of signiﬁcance in the northern coastal and northeastern areas. The coefﬁcient of the industrial soot emission in the eastern coastal regions is negative in model 2 but changes into positive after adding the public concern indicators and the mayors' characteristics in turn. The industrial soot emission in the southwestern and north- western areas has an indistinctive positive effect on mayors’ pro- motion in model 2 and 3, but a signiﬁcant hindering force at 10% level of promotion in model 4. The coefﬁcients of the industrial soot emission in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River keep negative in all the models. From the perspective of pressures from online public opinions, the coefﬁcients of school enrollment in general institutes of higher education are negative in the eastern coastal areas, the southern coastal areas and the middle reach of the Yangtze River. The co- efﬁcients of the northern coastal and northeastern regions and the southwestern and northwestern areas reversed to positive after adding the mayors' features, while the middle reaches of the Yellow River shows the opposite. The international internet users in the eastern coastal areas and the southern coastal areas have positive impacts on the mayors' promotion. The coefﬁcient in the northern coastal and northeastern areas changes into negative after consid- ering the mayors’ features, while the coefﬁcients in the middle reach of the Yellow River, the southwestern and northwestern areas, and the middle reaches of the Yangtze River change into positive. Ultimately, comparing with industrial SO2 emission, the im- pacts of the two indicators of mayors’ features keep robust when we consider the effects of industrial soot emission. 5. Conclusion This paper follows the concept of “promotion tournament” for Chinese mayors and investigates the inﬂuences of economic growth and the environmental situation on mayors’ promotion while considering various types of pollutants. Furthermore, we have chosen public opinion indicators and inspected whether they have exerted pressures on promotion. In the majority of empirical models, Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2 of this study is proved: inapparent pollutants have an unremarkable inﬂuence on Chinese mayors' promotion, yet most of which have positive effects. Apparent pollutants such as water pollution have entirely negative impacts on a mayor's turnover, whether on a nationwide level or a regional level. However, for the less developed areas of China, apparent pollution show positive effects. Among economic indicators, the models prove that the increase in the per capita disposable income of urban citizens exhibits noticeable positive effects on mayors' promotion, which illustrates that China's administrative evaluation system tends to be more practical about the assessment of local economic governance. The models also demonstrate that the public opinion indicator has a remarkable inﬂuence on promotion, the school enrollment in general institutes of higher education are negative while the in- ternational internet users have positive impacts on the mayors’ promotion. The public with tertiary education are more willing and capable to express appeals in a reasonable, legal and just way–as we mentioned in Hypothesis 3 ewhich illustrates that public opinions can exert pressures on promotion to some degree. Whether mayors take ofﬁce in his birthplace has obvious adverse effects on Chinese mayors' promotion, basically consistent with the tradition of China's “Take-ofﬁce-in-turns” convention, while whether getting promoted in the same place has apparent positive effects on Chinese mayors' promotion. When considering the mayors' characteristics, the inﬂuences of environmental constraint, economic demand, and public opinion pressures are no longer remarkable which to some extent demonstrates that the promotion of a Chinese administrative ofﬁcial depends more heavily on his political resume, instead of performance assessment. To sum up, despite that Chinese central government has modiﬁed its evaluation mechanism, local ofﬁcials are still apt to rely on improving economic achievements, thus leading to the low ef- ﬁciency of new appraisal standard. Protecting the environment cannot be just a slogan. Thus, reﬁning the environmental assess- ment technical standards, and strengthening the maneuverability of environmental regulation is imperative. For those inapparent pollutants, it is recommended that professional organizations regularly release pollutant emission situation on the government ofﬁcial website, as well as the economic data, employment data, and PM 2.5 emission data. Environmental governance is a sys- tematic program. It should set controlling object, conﬁrmed the reward and punishment mechanism, cleared the subsidy methods, and implemented the responsibility to particular department and individuals. Also, central government's attention should pay to different economic development levels in various regions. The economically backward areas face the economic and environ- mental trade off that have better follow a gradual and sustainable growth path. We also suggest the central government to provide more policies and technical support to the public to express their appeals. Furthermore, the period of this research's dataset is from 2003 to 2012. Since 2012, China's environmental protection has experi- enced a stronger trend, which may have a particular impact on the results. The observations need to be tracked for several other years to ﬁgure out whether the environmental protection is strengthened in the mayors' promotion mechanism. Our research discovers that ofﬁcials may be speculative and lazy in unobservable pollutant governance, and this conclusion may change under the new envi- ronmental constraints.

Introduction What explains the variation in local implementation of environ- mental policies or the lack thereof in China? Chinese local leaders’ behaviors are driven by a career incentive structure centered on a cadre evaluation system in which those who deliver high priority targets are more likely to be promoted (Birney, 2014).1 Despite the fact that new targets such as environmental protection and social stability have been added in recent years, promoting economic growth is still seen as the safest bet for career advancement (Heberer and Senz, 2011; Li and Zhou, 2005). Local leaders often signal competence when their super- iors actively collect evidence to evaluate their performances: these are often the one or two years leading up to the end of the recommended five-year term. Lessening the enforcement of environmental regulations to reduce local industries’ production costs and to attract firms from other jurisdictions is among the policy instruments used by local leaders at the end of their current tenure to create better economic perfor- mances. Such “selective policy implementation” of environmental reg- ulations creates an environmental political business cycle in which pollution increases in years leading to local leader turnover. We find strong empirical support in PM2.5 air pollution based on a panel dataset of Chinese prefectures of 2002–2010. The empirical analysis reveals a U-shaped relationship between a prefecture party secretary’s years in office and her prefecture’s average annual PM2.5 concentration. For a five-year term, the turnover year is associated with a PM level that is 0.57 μg per cubic meter (μg/m3) higher than mid-term years – a 2% increase over the mean PM2.5 level in Chinese prefectures (about 30 μg/m3) or a 6% increase over the World Health Organization guideline (10 μg/m3).2 This paper first contributes to the political business cycle literature. Building on past research (Guo, 2009), we move away from the usual focus – government expenditures driven by electoral cycles – and study a cycle in the enforcement of environmental regulations driven by the career incentive structure in the Chinese cadre system. Second, the paper contributes to the literature on career incentives by showing that career incentives of local officials also affect the environment.3 Third, we advance the environmental politics literature by providing a poli- tical economic explanation of pollution at a subnational level and in an authoritarian state. The authoritarian environmentalism literature stresses that authoritarian leaders have an advantage in compelling businesses and citizens to comply with stringent environmental reg- ulation (Beeson, 2010). Our findings show that due to political business cycles, local implementers in China do not follow a linear pattern. In- stead, local leaders have strong incentives to lessen the enforcement of https://doi.org/10.1016/j.envsci.2018.12.006 Received 27 June 2018; Received in revised form 4 November 2018; Accepted 3 December 2018 ⁎ Corresponding author at: Department of Political Science, Penn State University, 206 Pond Lab, University Park, PA 16802, USA.

(2012) argue that political connections affect promotion. 2 The guideline represents the lower end of the range over which one observes significant effects on survival (Pope et al., 2002). 3 Our theoretical intuition is similar to Shen (2016), which studies career-incentive cycles in Chinese prefecture-level GDP and air pollution.

Local air quality, often portrayed as affected by factors such as weather condi- tions, winter heating, and growth in automobile usage, indeed also varies based on such cyclical local environmental policy enforcement. Fourth, this paper provides a comprehensive explanation for local PM2.5 in China. Though our theoretical focus is on the environmental political business cycle, other empirical findings have profound policy implications. We find that the Environmental Kuznets Curve does not exist for PM2.5 in China, suggesting that waiting for things to improve without effective government interventions is not a promising strategy. We find coal production drives PM levels significantly: a top-10 coal sale prefecture is associated with PM2.5 level almost 30% higher than other prefectures. Finally, this paper highlights the use of non-govern- ment data in the study of Chinese politics. Official data from China is often subject to manipulation (Wallace, 2016), including pollution data (Ghanem and Zhang, 2014). Our empirical analysis uses satellite data from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), avoiding the problem of possible data manipulation. 2. Political business cycle and its environmental impacts 2.1. Political business cycles in local context Political business cycles are driven by elections in democracies as office-seeking governments pursue expansionary monetary and fiscal policies before and during election years in order to win elections (Alt and Lassen, 2006). Recent studies have discovered political business cycles not only in established democracies, but also in countries going through democratic transitions and even in countries considered es- tablished autocracies (Drazen, 2000). For authoritarian states such as China, Guo (2009) argues that county-level party secretaries accelerate government spending at the crucial point in the career path when the party committees at upper levels are about to make personnel decisions. He finds an inversed U- shaped relationship between local government expenditure growth and cadre’s year in office: expenditure peaks at the third or fourth year given a five term. Importantly, he shows that political business cycles exist without competitive elections: the desire to signal competence to their superiors also make local leaders strategically allocate limited resources to display their achievement at the most optimal time of their tenures. Incentive structures matter for political actors. In the Chinese con- text, recent studies focus on career incentive built in the cadre eva- luation system. This approach is often called the political tournaments theory. Borrowing the theory of yardstick competition from organiza- tion economics, several scholars have proposed this to explain eco- nomic growth in China (Chen et al., 2005; Li and Zhou, 2005). Local cadres compete in a tournament-style with their counterparts in neighboring districts over promotions to the next level.4 To maximize chances of promotion, they are motivated to develop local economies because the upper-level government makes promotion decisions by evaluating the performance of local officials based on the relative economic growth of jurisdictions (Maskin et al., 2000). The political tournaments theory has received criticisms. For in- stance, the economic performance of local leaders is endogenous. Some officials with certain characteristics (e.g., close ties to top leaders) are assigned to provinces with greater potentials of economic growth (Jia et al., 2015). Holmstrom and Milgrom (1991) suggest that tournament systems may break down with multiple tasks. Unless these competing policy priorities are incorporated into a single, comprehensive index, promotion-oriented officials will engage in “selective implementation” of national initiatives and focus their efforts on what they perceive to be the implicit priorities of their superiors (O’Brien and Li, 1999).5 The political tournaments theory is built on some crucial assump- tions. First, upper governments give priority to economic growth. Second, political promotion depends on local leaders’ ability to grow the economy. Finally, upper governments can gain accurate measure- ments of local leaders’ ability by observing relative GDP growth after taking into account many exogenous shocks and factor endowments. We need to modify the final assumption if we were to observe po- litical business cycles. If upper-level governments are able to get access to 100% information and have sufficient time and resources to evaluate every lower government’s performance during an “anticipated” five- year term, the timing for a local government to exert efforts should not matter. In other words, their superior only cares and evaluates the overall economic performances over a five-year term. However, the political business cycles thesis emphasizes that a local government should exert efforts when it is optimal to impress its superior simply, because in the real world, upper-level government officials do not have sufficient time, resources, and information to make such objective es- timates. Meanwhile, like voters in elections, they are likely to discount past performances because current performances are much more visible to them. In a democracy, the incumbent signals competence to voters right before the election when the voters are paying attention. If we can assume that the Chinese cadre system is also characterized by in- complete information and/or that the superiors discount past economic performances, local officials should rationally produce political busi- ness cycles to signal competence when higher-level party committee members are looking for signals of competence.6 According to Guo (2009), rapid growth in government spending on large development projects is costly and may be unsustainable. Local leaders have to schedule carefully such periods of high performance at crucial moments during their time in office: it would be unwise to increase government spending too fast in a leader's first year in office, because a promotion is unlikely to happen so early and such effort is likely to be wasted. At the same time, increasing government efforts only at the year of turnover would be too late for the effects to be visible to the superiors. The optional time to perform to impress higher-up leaders should be the years leading to the turnover year. 2.2. Environmental impacts of political business cycles We expect that somewhere close to the turnover year, leaders are most motivated to perform. Increasing local GDP and investing in visible “political achievement projects” often have the highest short- term payoff. Policy instruments to achieve these goals are often through increasing local government expenditures, for example, by investing in infrastructures. Such investment projects often have negative environmental im- pacts. For instance, building and using roads are often associated with more air pollution. Moreover, increased local GDP as a function of local government expenditures will increase total pollution because of the scale effect. Pollution caused by infrastructure development and by 4 Not all government officials are responsive to such incentives (Gao, 2017; Kou and Tsai, 2014). E.g., prefecture party secretaries’ mandatory retirement age is 60; those too close to 60 might perceive themselves as non-promotable, having little incentive to perform. We experimented with adding variables such as prefecture party secretary’s age, its square term, and dummy variables in- dicating whether a leader is older than an age threshold. None of these variables is statistically significant. 5 While environmental targets are substantially more important now, they compete for space on an already crowded agenda of local officials. Many local officials continue to maximize growth because they know too few cases where local leaders were promoted because of their better achievements in environ- mental protection (Interview, May 2012, Hunan province). 6 Decisions are made by Party’s organization department, which makes a recommendation to the Party committee members.

       " Document(page_content='increasing size of the economy is difficult to avoid for developing countries. (Empirically, we control for these two mechanisms by in- cluding variables such as road area size and GDP growth rate.) Our focus is on whether local governments use other instruments with ob- servable environmental impacts. Environmental regulations and their enforcements are important policy instruments. In the Chinese context, many environmental laws and regulations are designed at the central level. Their implementation, on the other hand, is largely in the hands of local leaders.7 It is the implementation of existing laws and regulations that can be manipu- lated by local officials. For instance, in 2013, the State Council ap- proved the Action Plan for Air Pollution Prevention and Control, which outlines specific PM2.5 air pollution targets for local governments to follow, but local governments have significant leeway in selecting an implementation approach to meet these targets. Cai et al. (2016) show that local governments can affect the stringency of enforcement via the collection of pollution fees and the inspection of violations. Lessening or non-compliance with existing regulations lowers firms’ production costs. In the Chinese context, for example, Dasgupta et al. (2001a) show that for a small paper factory that on average discharges 327,800 tons of wastewater yearly, the cost of reducing 90% suspended solids alone is $452,364 in 1994. Moreover, if firms are mobile, jur- isdictions with lower de facto environmental regulations attract pollu- tion intensive firms. This is the pollution haven hypothesis, which has received empirical support in the Chinese context (Dean et al., 2009). For instance, Zhu et al. (2014) find that Chinese pollution-intensive firms have relocated from the coastal province Zhejiang to inland China, where enforcement of environmental regulation is laxer. There are many anecdotal cases to support the trade-off between economic growth and enforcement of environmental regulations. For instance, triggered by national pressures to lower pollution, provincial leaders in Shanxi province began to reduce coal production and closed many private coalmines and coke washing companies in 2008 and 2009. As a result, GDP growth dramatically dropped to only 4%, making Shanxi one of the slowest growing provinces in China. Responding to this economic crisis, in 2010 provincial leaders reversed their green growth strategy and started to reopen some of the coalmines and to approve new coal projects (The Economist, 2015). Legal scholars have pointed out that the Chinese environmental legislation on paper is plentiful and powerful; the problem is local en- forcement (Van Rooij, 2006). For instance, despite central govern- ment’s efforts to clean up, the Huai River remains one of the most polluted rivers in China. Many believe that one fundamental reason is the fact that polluting factories along the river contribute significantly to local economy; local officials had strong incentives not to (fully) enforce environmental regulations (Economy, 2004). However, there are also costs associated with environmental de- gradation. For instance, severe pollution can cause local political unrest (Steinhardt and Wu, 2016),8 which often threatens the future career of responsible officials: social stability is one of the veto targets in China for local officials. Therefore, local leaders need to take into account potential political risks associated with severe and visible pollution. This is the reason why the instrument of manipulating environmental regulation enforcement to trade environmental quality for economic growth should only be used when it matters the most for the future career of the local leaders.9 Based on our previous discussion on the political business cycles in China, these are the years leading to a cadre’s year of turnover. Therefore, we expect to see an environmental political business cycle in which years leading to the formal turnover year of prefecture party secretaries are associated with more pollution. 3. Data 3.1. Dependent variable There is significant within-province variation in air pollution in China (Fig. 1(b)), which motivates us to focus on prefecture-level dif- ferences.10 Our dependent variable, PM2.5, is the prefecture annual average concentration levels of particulate matter of 2.5 μm or smaller, measured in micrograms per cubic meter. We use the Annual PM2.5 Grids dataset from the NASA,11 which are grid-cells with 0.5 × 0.5 decimal degree resolution (55 km by 55 km at the Equator): see 2001 data of China in Fig. 1(a). We re-sampled the grid-cells in ArcMap by evenly dividing each grid into 100 smaller grids; we overlaid the re- sampled grids to prefecture polygons of China, taking the average PM2.5 concentration levels of all resampled grids falling within a pre- fecture polygon. PM2.5 is a complex mixture with extremely small particles and li- quid droplets including combustion particles, organic compounds, and metals. Because they are much smaller than inhalable coarse particles (PM10), their negative effects on human health are much more severe. Exposure to PM2.5 is associated with premature death and increased morbidity from respiratory and cardiovascular disease (Pui et al., 2014). Fig. 1(b) shows that the areas with highest levels of PM2.5 concentrations are in the southern North China Plain, along the lower Yellow River, namely southern Hebei, western Shandong, and northern Henan provinces. In China, fine particulates are mostly from vehicle and industrial combustion emissions (Guan et al., 2014). The fact that its major sources are economic activities such as electricity generation and in- dustrial production makes PM2.5 a good measure for our study because government environmental regulations can affect such economic ac- tivities’ environmental impacts. Increased enforcement effort can lead to better environmental quality. Surveying studies on the US, Gray and Shimshack (2011) reveal that environmental monitoring and enforce- ment reduce future violations at targeted and non-targeted firms. Laplante and Rilstone (1996) find that government inspections reduced water pollution by 28% in 47 Canadian pulp and paper mills. Dasgupta et al. (2001b) show that state inspections of manufacturing facilities in Zhenjiang reduced water pollution by 0.4 to 1.2%. 7 Local environmental regulations exist. However, a change in local regula- tion has to go through the local People’s Congress and People’s Political Consultative Conference. Moreover, environmental regulations only get stricter over time. It is unlikely that local governments would lessen environmental regulations by creating new, less stringent laws. 8 The risk of environmental protest is also often related to factors such as the strength and resources of local civil society, citizens’ background, media re- porting, and government censorship (Cai, 2010; O’Brien and Li, 2006). 9 The link between pollution and social unrest is not deterministic. Severe (footnote continued) pollution does not necessarily result in social unrest. Other reasons such as land grabbing and corruption, for many, are the more common causes. Local leaders have means to prevent protests, such as offering compensation, repression, and falsifying environment data. Therefore, trading environmental quality for eco- nomic growth in years leading to leadership turnover carries risks, but does not always threaten the veto target of social stability. Moreover, there can be a time lag effect with pollution. Lessening regulatory enforcement attracts new firms. Local leaders can list new investments as achievements even before factories are constructed. Sometimes, the construction of pollution intensive factories does not generate much pollution immediately: they might start producing months or years later. E.g., it can take between 5 to 7 years to build an average-size greenfield oil refinery. 10 Counties, especially those of east China, are often small and we simply do not see much variation in annual average air pollution among neighbouring counties. 11 http://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/sdei-global-annual-avg-pm2-5- 2001-2010, accessed July 2013.

       " Document(page_content=\"3.2. Explanatory variables A party secretary is higher in rank than a mayor is and is the pri- mary decision-maker when it comes to salient policies.12 Therefore, we focus on party secretary characteristics.13 We first construct a dummy variable year before turnover. For a party secretary who did not serve more than one term, this variable takes the value 1 for the year before his/her actual political turnover; and 0 otherwise. For a leader who went on for a second term – of the 600 party secretaries in our data, 100 served more than one term – we also code the 5th year in office as the year before turnover (therefore taking the value of 1): the con- stitutionally stipulated term for a party secretary is five years; the 6th year would be the turnover year or the 1st year of the second term.14 Moreover, we follow a more conventional way of testing political business cycles, using a variable measuring a leader’ years in office (years in office) and its square term (years in office 2) to test a U-shaped relationship between years in office and air pollution. We code the variable as “1″ for the first year in office, “2″ for the second year in office, and so on. Since some party secretaries stayed two terms in of- fice, we expect that there will be two political business cycles for them: the cycle repeats during the second term. Thus, if one serves a second term, we recode the 6th to 10th year in office to be 1–5 again. We also include a dummy variable second term indicating the second term of a party secretary – those who stay in office for two terms might have stronger desire to signal competence to superiors to get promo- tion. As stipulated in the Temporary Provisions on the Tenure of Leading Officials of the Party and the Government (2006), cadres who stay 15 years at the same level will not be considered for positions at the same level. Interviews with local officials from Eaton and Kostka (2014) further reveal an informal rule that after two full terms, one cannot take the same job again. 3.3. Control variables We control for two other leader characteristics. prov connect is a dummy variable indicating whether the party secretary has connections in the provincial government: 1 if he/she had worked in provincial government before; 0 otherwise. Cadres with provincial connections may be able to better circumvent environment regulations. SOE ex- perience indicates whether the party secretary had worked in state- owned enterprises previously. Cadres with SOE experience may be more development-oriented and likely to ignore environment regula- tions. We include a prefecture’s GDP per capita (inflation-adjusted) and GDP per cap2: they test the Environmental Kuznets Curve – pollution increases with development first, reaching the highest point before going down. We control for GDP growth rate (in percentage). Furthermore, pop density is population density in persons per square kilometer. We include FDI per cap to control the effects of globalization (Zeng and Eastin, 2007). The variable urban (ratio of non-agricultural to the whole population) measures the level of urbanization. To control for the effects of infrastructure building, we use road per cap, which is the size of paved road per person in a prefecture-year (in square meters).15 The surge in passenger cars is one key factor for air pollution in China (Westerdahl et al., 2009). Data on private cars and means of public transportation at the prefecture level are not available. What we have is taxi per cap: the number of taxis per ten thousand population in a prefecture-year.16 Taxi is a substitute for private cars. Everything else equal, more taxi usage should reduce private car demands.17 Coal is the most important fossil fuel for China. Data on coal pro- duction/consumption are not available at the prefecture level. The only source available is a list of top 10 coal sale prefectures (China Data Online). Thus, we construct a dummy variable indicating top 10 coal sale status. Moreover, power plants are an important source of air pollution. The Carma Project (http://carma.org/plant) provides prob- ably the most comprehensive list of power plants in China. The esti- mation of carbon emission from Carma is not accurate enough outside the US (Afsah and Ness, 2008). Therefore, we count the number of power plants within a prefecture. This is a time-invariant variable because Carma has no information on years of operation. We include dist to Beijing (distance to Beijing) and dist to prov cap (to the provincial capital), in kilometers. Closer distance to the center might incentivize local leaders to signal competence to their superiors because their efforts have a higher chance to be noticed by central/ provincial governments. More efforts in visible projects, and to max- imize GDP growth in general, can result in environmental degradation. Finally, we control for the effects of elevation because particulates tend to sink to the bottom. elevation is the average elevation of a prefecture, in meters above sea level.18 Summary and correlation statistics are in Table A-1/A-2 of online appendices (online appendices available at: https://sites.psu.edu/xuncao/files/2016/01/blinded-version_gk_xc_ appendix-y3uls7.pdf). 4. Statistical results We model prefecture level annual average PM2.5 concentrations in Chinese prefectures, 2002–2010,19 as a function of political business cycle variables and a battery of control variables. We use both random- and fixed-prefecture effects models. Fixed effects model is a con- servative strategy when there is a possibility of estimation bias due to uncontrolled factors correlated with independent variables. In our case, the number of units (prefectures) is large: one has to estimate a very large number of parameters. We also have a few time-invariant vari- ables: fixed-effects model does not allow to test the effect associated with these variables. Therefore, we exclude these variables in model specifications 5–8 (fixed effects models) in Table 1. Random (pre- fecture) effects model (specifications 1–4) is more efficient, but it is based on the assumption that random effects are uncorrelated with the regressors. We use year-fixed effects in all models to control for common shocks. In model specifications 1, 3, 5, and 7, we use clustered standard error (clustered on prefectures) that estimate standard errors robust to heteroskedasticity and within-group correlation; the latter, in the panel data context, would normally mean within-panel serial correlation. In model specifications 2, 4, 6, and 8, we instead specify the within-panel serial correlation as an AR1 process. 12 Eaton and Kostka (2014): “Within the leadership group, party secretaries usually hold the pre-eminent position and are seen as the first hand, while mayors are, ordinarily, the second hand and subordinate to the Party secre- taries.” 13 Most biographies are from municipal government websites; remaining ones are from the Internet. 14 See Clause 106 of the “Constitution of the People's Republic of China”. However, it is hard to verify empirically how local officials anticipate their term length. Based on biographies of prefecture party secretaries between 1993 and 2011, the average tenure is 3.8 years. Between 1993 and 2001, the average is 4.2 years. These are not far from the 5-year legal term. Therefore, we think it is reasonable to assume a de facto 5-year term. 15 We also standardize the road variable by city area size. The new variable is not statistically significant. 16 The number of unlicensed taxis is not captured by this variable. 17 Data on GDP per capita, growth rate, population density, FDI, urbanization, road density, and taxi are from China Economic Information Network and China City Statistical Yearbook. 18 The elevation raster data is from http://www.diva-gis.org/gdata. 19 We do not include 2001 because GDP growth rate data is missing for 2001.

       " Document(page_content='4.1. Effects of environmental political business cycle variables Table 1 shows the results of the models with the before turnover year and years in office variables. Both are statistically significant across all specifications. Regarding substantive effects, the mean coefficient es- timates are similar across model specifications. Using model 6, the mean coefficient estimate is around 0.44 for the year before turnover variable. This suggests that the year before leadership turnover ex- perienced a PM2.5 level 0.44 μg per cubic meter higher than other years. Holding all other variables at their mean levels, the predicted PM2.5 level is 33.6 μg per cubic meter, which is very close to the mean PM level from the data. This suggests that the year before turnover experienced about 1.5% increase in PM2.5 compared to other years. This is based on the alarmingly high PM pollution in China. The WHO and EPA guidelines are only 10 and 12 μg per cubic meter. For these baselines, a 0.44 increase is an even more important change in air pollution. The more conventional way to test a political business cycle is to include years in office and its square term. In all four model specifi- cations (3, 4, 7, and 8), the signs and mean coefficient estimates of years in office and years in office 2 suggest a U-shaped relationship between leaders’ years in office and PM2.5, with the lowest PM level around the third year in office and the highest levels in the last year (year before turnover) and the turnover year. There is often some time lag between the year that a leader decides to lessen environmental regulations and the year in which one observes actual PM increase. It seems that a leader starts the process of changing implementation about halfway through their tenure, which is reflected in increasing levels of PM pollution starting around the fourth year; the leader continues such “efforts” till the last year in office; the environmental impacts of such efforts linger on until the turnover year (the first year of the next term). In terms of the substantive effect, the difference between year 5 (the year before the turnover) and year 3 is about 0.48 – a 1.6% increase over mean PM2.5 level.

       " Document(page_content='The second term variable also has a statistically significant and substantively important effect. Using model specification 6 again, ev- erything else equal, years in a party secretary’s second term are on average associated with a PM level 0.8 μg per cubic meter higher than first term years. This translates into about 2.5% of the average PM level. It seems that leaders in the second term are indeed under more pressure to signal competence for promotion because chances of staying in the same post for a third term are slim. In Fig. 2, we simulate the combined effect of the years in office, years in office 2 and second term variables based on specification 8 in Table 1. Holding other variables at their mean levels, we simulate the predicted levels of PM as a function of a party secretary’s year in office, that is, from year 1 to year 5, and whether she/he is in the second term. For each of the other nine years included in the two terms, we calculate the differences in the predicted PM levels from the first year of the first five- year term; we plot the 90% confidence intervals of these differences, by vertical gray lines, and the mean predicted differences, by solid dark dots. (The difference of predicted PM level of the first year of the first term from itself is zero; therefore, we plot a single dot with no con- fidence interval for this year.) We see two clear U-shaped patterns: these are two environmental political business cycles with the second cycle associated with higher PM levels thanks to the effect of the second term variable. Moreover, the difference between the 5th year in the second term and the third year in the first term is substantively im- portant: 1.5 μg per cubic meter, or 5% of the average PM level.20 One might question whether prefecture party secretary tenure variables simply pick up the effects of other time-varying confounding factors such as economic plans at the national level, provincial-level leadership tenure, or even county-level leader appointments. We use year-fixed effects in all model specifications to control for national trends, common shocks, and influences of common central policies. For provincial leader cycles, we created three provincial party secretary tenure variables following the same rules coding prefecture party se- cretary variables. It turns out that prefecture party secretary tenure variables do not correlate with their provincial counterparts: the cor- relations are 0.044, 0.005, and 0.023 respectively for the turnover year, years in office, and second term variables.21 Finally, coding county leader tenure variables for more than 2000 counties is beyond the scope of this paper. We do, however, have some anecdotal evidence that county cycles do not correlate with prefecture ones. For instance, in a study of the Xiaoyi County of the Shanxi province, Eaton and Kostka (2013) find that county leader appointments simply do not coincide with their prefecture superiors’. One final rival theoretical expectation between local leader tenure and pollution concerns regulatory capture: the longer a cadre is in office in one location, the more he/she is embedded in local business relations, and the higher the possibility of bureaucratic capture and corruption, which leads to weaker enforcement of regula- tion, resulting in higher pollution. If this rival hypothesis is correct, pollution should be a linear and positive function of years in office. We do not find empirical support for this linear positive relationship.22 4.2. Effects of control variables Table 1 shows that provincial connection and SOE working ex- perience do not affect PM levels. We do not find an Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC), which resonates with recent studies (Arvin and Lew, 2011). Neither GDP growth rate nor road density affects PM le- vels. With the same level of pollution intensity, increased output should increase pollution. The fact that we find no connection between growth and pollution suggests that Chinese prefectures have decreased pollu- tion intensity.23 At the same time, the statistical significance for the urbanization variable varies by model specifications. Furthermore, we find no evidence associating per capita FDI inflows with PM2.5. Distance matters: the further away a prefecture is from Beijing and from its provincial capital, the lower the PM level. The other two time- invariant variables also affect PM level. Elevation matters as expected. Top 10 coal sale prefectures are on average associated with between 8.5 and 8.7 more micrograms per cubic meter PM2.5, which translates into a 28–29% increase in the mean PM level. We find no connection between the number of power plants and PM levels. This is not surprising given we do not have information on plant size and the type of fuel used. We find that the number of taxis (per ten thousand population) is negatively associated with PM2.5. Holding all variables at the mean level, increasing the taxi variable by one standard deviation from the mean, PM2.5 decreases by about 3% from the mean.24 Potential spatial spill-over effects of air pollution – pollutants move with wind from one location to another – can be controlled by adding a spatial lag (e.g., the weighted average value of the dependent variable in “neighboring” units) and estimating using spatial models. Empirically, it is almost impossible to figure out prevailing wind di- rections for all Chinese prefectures as wind directions often change over seasons. More importantly, even if the underlying data generating process is a spatial lag model – one prefecture’s annual average PM level is affected by those of adjacent up-wind prefectures – and the covariates of interest (political business cycle variables) are un- correlated with the spatial lag (that is, adjacent up-wind prefectures’ PM levels),25 the estimates of coefficients of the political business cycle variables contain both the direct effect and the spatial feedback effect (Franzese and Hays, 2007). The spatial feedback effects can be inter- preted as follows: an environmental business cycle affects prefecture i’s PM levels, which affect its neighboring prefectures’ PM levels, which in turn affect back i’s PM levels, most likely as wind directions change over Fig. 2. Simulated Effects of Change in PM2.5 levels from the First Year as a Function of a Party Secretary’s Year in Office during Two Terms. 20 In Fig. 2, the simulated PM2.5 level in year 6 is higher than year 5 because, first, there is often a time lag effect: a newly constructed factory in the turnover year does not generate much pollution immediately. It might start producing at full capacity months or even years later. Second, the increased PM level in year 6 is also due to an added average effect of the second term variable. 21 Including provincial party secretary variables does not change our main results. 22 Regression results available upon request. 23 GDP growth might have a long-lasting effect: building a new expressway might drive up long-term air pollution even though growth slows down in following years. In online appendices (Table A-3), we lag GDP growth by a year. The lagged variable is not consistently statistically significant. 24 We have more robustness checks in online appendices: e.g., see Table A-4/ A-5. 25 It is unlikely that a local leader’s tenure correlates with neighbor pre- fectures’ pollution.

This actually works in our favor because we care about not only the short-term, direct effect, but also long-term feedback effects associated with career incentive variables.26 5. Conclusion Our theory predicts an environmental political business cycle in Chinese local governance. We find empirical support in PM2.5, sug- gesting that local leaders behave cyclically in China. Before the pro- motion to the next job, they tend to be laxer in enforcing environmental standards. Once a local leader moves on to a new post, she/he is also no longer held responsible for previous actions. This inability to hold cadres responsible for environmental damage recently prompted a central government call for “lifetime accountability” for cadres. In 2015, the State Council approved the inclusion of such a lifetime ac- countability rule for environmental pollution in the new “Guidelines of Pushing the Construction of Eco-Civilization.”27 Yet, whether such a rule can be effectively enforced remains to be seen. Indeed, significant changes happened after 2010. E.g., in 2013, the central government launched the “war against air pollution.” Environmental targets were included in the revised 2014 Environmental Protection Law for county-level evaluations and above.28 Therefore, it remains an open question whether one would observe same environmental political business cycles after 2010 when environmental protection became an important target for local gov- ernments. In an extreme case, if environment performance became one of the most important factors for promotion, we might find that leaders work on environmental issues in years leading to promotion, resulting in an opposite environmental political business cycle. In addition to the politics of political business cycles, there are other potential political explanations for local pollution in China. First, local interest groups might play important roles and one should look at pollution intensive industries and their abilities to lobby the govern- ment. One recent study shows that in China, cities dominated by large industrial firms lagged in implementing environmental transparency, and this effect appears strongest when a city’s largest firm is in a highly polluting industry (Lorentzen et al., 2014). Moreover, Fisman and Wang (2015) provide suggestive evidence that political connections enable firms to avoid costly safety compliance measures. Finally, another framework that we might be able to follow is Ward et al. (2014) in which they show that at the national level, authoritarian governments with stronger state capacity are associated with higher pollution because they invest more in infrastructure (that often gen- erates pollution) than in environmental protection. Whether this holds at the subnational level needs to be tested. We have seen some pre- liminary evidence. For instance, Wu et al. (2013) show that there is significant gap between infrastructure and environmental investments in Chinese cities; yet they do not show whether such gap varies as a function of local government state capacity. While more research is needed to better understand the intricate connections between career incentives and the environment in China, we hope this paper has pro- vided a solid foundation for this new and exciting area of research.

       " Document(page_content='China’s Local Political Budget Cycles Gang Guo The University of Mississippi This article examines the political budget cycles in Chinese counties. The shift to a more performance-based cadre evaluation and mobility system during the reform era has created an incentive structure for local leaders to increase government spending at strategically important time points during their tenure to enhance the prospect of official promotion. Such expenditures help local leaders to impress their superiors with economic and political achievements, especially those visible and quantifiable large-scale development projects. At the same time, economic and fiscal decentralization increased the capacity of local leaders to influence government budget expenditures as the need rises. The hypothesized curvilinear relationship between a leader’s time in office and increased spending was tested using a comprehensive data set of all Chinese counties from 1997 through 2002. The panel data analysis shows that growth in local government spending per capita is the fastest during a leader’s third and fourth years in office. P olitical business cycles have been the subject of a large and growing literature in political science and economics in the past few decades. In demo- cratic regimes, political business cycles are largely driven by popular elections, a central institutional feature of democracy. Studies on Western democracies have shown both theoretically and empirically that governments are more likely to pursue expansionary monetary and fiscal policies immediately before and during election years. Some recent studies have also shown the effect of the electoral calendar on economic policy in new democra- cies emerging from communist rule. Elected officials in postcommunist countries strategically implement com- mercial reforms immediately after each election so as to allow sufficient time both for the short-term economic cost of reform to subside and for the long-term benefits of reform to materialize before voters go to the polls again (Frye and Mansfield 2004, 375). Outside of Western democracies, scholars have also uncovered economic policy cycles in the former Soviet Union and in China that rhyme with national leader- ship succession or factional politics. In an authoritarian regime, there apparently is no such direct connection be- tween the general population and the political elite as democratic elections.

Roeder (1985, 959) countered that Soviet leaders only had to satisfy a proximate electorate drawn from the up- permost reaches of the society. No matter how large the electorate is, there exists the possibility that at the top of authoritarian systems, national economic policy may synchronize with leadership succession or factional poli- tics. Bunce argued that “the volatile nature of power at the apexoftheSovietsystem,thenatureofthesuccessionpro- cess, and the ideological propensity and the pronounced capacity to link political concerns with policy priorities would all seem to set in motion certain cyclical shifts in public policy priorities in the early rather than later years of an administration” (1980, 967).

In either case, a former Soviet leader “assumes different roles and advocates different priorities at different times” during his tenure (Bunce 1980, 967). Especially budget expenditures rhymed with the political life cycle of each generation of leaders.

A similarly drastic economic cycle of boom and bust also followed the political pendulum during the early years of the Cultural Revolution. In the post-Mao reform era, fis- cal and monetary cycles have tended to rhyme with more institutionalized political events, such as the plenary ses- sions of the National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party and of the National People’s Congress (Tao 2006, 165). Both sessions have been convened regularly every five years since the late 1970s and have been the only oc- casions of substantial turnover of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and of the national government, respectively. Despite the fundamental political differences be- tween democratic and authoritarian systems, two key common premises lie at the theoretical foundation of political business cycles in both settings. First, politicians’ incentive structure regarding economic and fiscal policies is significantly affected by concerns over their future po- litical career, even in the absence of competitive elections. Second, politicians have sufficient power and responsi- bility to execute economic or fiscal policy changes despite various institutional and political constraints. However, when applied to the local levels in China, both theoreti- cal premises can become questionable. First, in a unitary communist system like China, local cadres are often as- sumed to be no more than mere puppets of the central party-state. Their political fate depends entirely on their loyalty or personal connection to party leaders at upper levels. Therefore, Chinese local officials should have no incentive at all to manipulate the local government bud- get or economy. All they have to do is to follow blindly commands and directives from above. Second, even if the local leaders wanted to influence the economic con- dition of their jurisdictions, they would have no means to achieve that, because the power to make decisions on economic or fiscal policies is completely centralized in China. While those assumptions have some plausibility, it will be argued in the next two sections respectively that local leaders in contemporary China have both the necessary incentive and sufficient capacity to implement economic and fiscal changes in their jurisdictions. The empirical implication is that Chinese local leaders strate- gically accelerate government spending at crucial mo- ments during their tenure, specifically when their chances of promotion in the following year are the highest. The third section tests that hypothesis using a comprehensive panel data set of all Chinese counties from 1997 through 2002. Incentives for Local Political Budget Cycles Ultimately local officials in China owe their political career to the party committee at the next higher level rather than to the general public in their jurisdiction. Unlike their counterparts in a democracy who have to face voters in regular elections and thus can become the scapegoat or beneficiary of various local economic con- ditions, Chinese local leaders are effectively shielded from such downward accountability to the ordinary masses. In the Chinese system, the names of local leaders are on the nomenklatura controlled by the party committee at the next higher level rather than on the ballot cast by voters. Therefore, the incentive structure of local leaders depends crucially on what the party committees want instead of on what the people want. While a voter in democracies may judge leaders retrospectively according to personal or national economic well-being, the party-state in China may judge local leaders retrospectively according to the economic and political achievements that those leaders have made. Since the Chinese communist party shifted the focus of its work from class struggle to economic con- struction in December 1978, its right to rule has been based increasingly on the claim of an exclusive ability to make China rich and strong rather than on the ideo- logical commitment to orthodox socialism. In a survey conducted in Zhejiang Province in 1997, 70% of the 228 party and government cadres interviewed agreed or “ba- sically agreed” that “it does not matter whether to adopt socialism or capitalism as long as the nation is rich and strong” (Wang 1999, 71). The party’s obsession with eco- nomic growth has been translated into its greater empha- sis on the “zhengji” (political achievement) of local lead- ers, which may be more truthfully phrased as “economic achievement” in the post-Mao era. In order to create an incentive structure conducive to economic development, the regime has made serious efforts to institutionalize the linkage between local leaders’ career advancement and their economic performance. Since 1979, the party’s cen- tral committee and central organization department have promulgated a series of party regulations, guidelines, and other important documents that place prominent em- phasis on actual performance measures in the evaluation and political mobility of party cadres and government officials (Central Committee 1995, 2002; Central Organi- zation Department 1979, 1988, 1998). Indeed some em- pirical evidence of the economic accountability of Chi- nese provincial officials has started to emerge (Guo 2007, 379). In his comprehensive study of Chinese provinces from 1949 to 1998, Bo (2002, 139) found that in the', metadata={'author': 'Gang Guo', 'year': '2009', 'title': 'China{\\\\textquotesingle}s Local Political Budget Cycles', 'journal': 'American Journal of Political Science'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CHINA’S LOCAL POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLES 623 reform era those provincial leaders with worse economic growth or fiscal contribution are more likely to be de- moted or retired. Li and Zhou similarly found that from 1979 to 1995 “the promotion (termination) probability of provincial leaders increases (decreases) with the aver- age performance” (2005, 1756) measured in annual GDP growth rate. Although leadership turnover remains essentially po- litical in the communist nomenklatura system, reforms in the post-Mao era have also held local leaders responsible for the economic conditions of their jurisdiction. More specifically, the “cadre responsibility system” was intro- duced from the provincial level down in the mid-1980s and governs job assignment, performance appraisal, and remuneration (O’Brien and Li 1999, 172). A direct and perhaps unintended consequence of the cadre responsi- bility system is that local leaders now pay more atten- tion to the more quantifiable and easily measurable tar- gets such as economic growth and development projects, at the expense of other less quantifiable performance measures. A persistent craze among local governments during the reform era is the building of large-scale de- velopment projects so that the leaders can impress their superiors with their economic achievements. “Now that economic development has been made the focus of all work, ambitious cadres often champion development projects” (O’Brien and Li 1999, 175). Such projects are nicknamed “zhengji gongcheng” (political achievement projects) or more bluntly “leader promotion projects” (Yang 2003, 22). As an indication of their prevalence, the People’s Daily, the official national newspaper of the Chi- nese Communist Party, has published over 400 articles on the so-called “political achievement projects” since 2000. It may seem puzzling why such excessive spending by local leaders on “political achievement projects” would be tolerated and even rewarded by upper-level party com- mittees. First of all, local leaders’ superiors benefit from such projects too, for which they can take credit and use to impress in turn their superiors at the provin- cial or national levels. Moreover, the rationale behind “political achievement projects” from the perspective of higher leaders should be placed in the context of asym- metric information. The relationship between Chinese local leaders and their superiors resembles a standard principal-agent problem in which the talent, competence, and even effort of the agents are not directly observable (Stiglitz 2002, 465). In a democracy, voters “cannot di- rectly observe the incumbent policymaker’s quality; in- stead, they extract information about her quality from observed economic outcomes” (Lohmann 1998, 2). In the Chinese context, the superiors do not have complete information on local leaders’ quality, and continuous monitoring or inspection of their subordinates’ effort would be too costly. Not only are large-scale development projects more visible and quantifiable, but they are also a more reliable and direct measure of agents’ effort and competence than economic indicators are. From the su- periors’ standpoint, precisely because large development projects are so costly they indicate the desirable compe- tence, ingenuity, and/or diligent effort of local leaders to extract more resources from local people and businesses to help pay for them. In addition, local cadres “visiting ministries to lobby for money [for projects] has become a reasonable activity that [their superiors] tacitly approve of and even solemnly stipulate in official documents with red headings as an important criterion in examining the capability and talent of local cadres” (Peng 2006, 9). From the perspective of local leaders, it is rational to exert effort on improving their performance measures according to the classic career-concerns model. Specifi- cally, Holmstr¨om (1999) formalized the idea in a theo- retical model that under incomplete information career concerns induce efficient managerial behavior. “The key insight of the career concern model is that, even in the absence of monetary incentives, an agent of uncertain talent expends effort in order to convince the relevant ‘labour market’ of her high talent; a high performance raises the perception of her ability and translates into fu- turejobopportunitieswithinoroutsidetheorganization” (Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Tirole 1999, 201). That insight can be generalized to the Chinese setting to model the be- havior of promotion-seeking local officials, whose talent is incomplete information to their immediate superiors, the equivalence of decision makers in the relevant “labor market.” One implication of Dewatripont, Jewitt, and Ti- role’s findings is that in “a multitask context . . . the agent can end up focusing on the set of tasks the market expects her to focus on” (1999, 201), which for Chinese local lead- ers means visible and quantifiable economic performance measures. That also seems to conform to anecdotal evi- dence of where Chinese local leaders exert most of their effort. A telling example is the experience in the United States of Li Qun, then mayor of the county-level city of Shouguang in Shandong Province. When asked by the mayor of New Haven, Connecticut, about the differences between their jobs, he said: “The biggest difference is that you do not seem to manage the economy much. When I was mayor of Shouguang my main effort was on grasping the economy, everything from fiscal growth to enterprise profit, peasant income, private economy, structural ad- justment . . .” (Song and He 2003). If visible, quantifiable economic performance mea- sures such as development projects can boost the prospect of official promotion, it is natural to expect that Chinese', metadata={'author': 'Gang Guo', 'year': '2009', 'title': 'China{\\\\textquotesingle}s Local Political Budget Cycles', 'journal': 'American Journal of Political Science'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='624 GANG GUO local leaders will try all out to help their political career. However, timing is a crucial consideration here that leads to political cycles in public finance decisions. Whereas in a democracy, one “purpose of a political business cy- cle is to signal competence to voters” (Alt and Lassen 2006, 530), the Chinese nomenklatura system coupled with incomplete information and retrospective economic accountability create incentives for local officials to pro- duce political budget cycles to signal competence to party committees at upper levels. Specifically, we would expect local leaders to accelerate government spending at certain points during their tenure to maximize their chances of being promoted. Rapid growth in government spending on large development projects is costly and may be un- sustainable, and local leaders have to schedule carefully such periods of high performance at crucial moments during their time in office. It would be unwise to increase government spending too fast in a leader’s first couple of years in office, because a promotion is unlikely to happen so early during his or her tenure and such effort would be wasted. Besides, high growth in the early years makes it more difficult to produce impressive performance mea- sures in later years that would help the leader to get a promotion. It would be equally unwise to accelerate government spending too late, that is, after a leader has stayed in the same position for a long period of time. In that case, the leader may never get a promotion and will probably retire as a county-level cadre eventually, and so any effort to im- prove performance measures so late in his or her tenure would also be wasted. As the leader grows older in the po- sition, age will start to become an obstacle to official pro- motion. In the reform era the party has taken to task the old system of lifelong official careers (zhongshenzhi) and emphasized promotion of younger cadres (Deng [1980] 1993, 323). At the same time, a mandatory cadre retire- mentsystemhasbeeninstalledatalllevels(Manion1993). By the late 1990s, most of the 720,000 middle-aged and young cadres promoted to leadership positions at the county level or above had to be replaced (He 2004, 6). Top county leaders have to retire at the age of 55, and only cadres below 45 can be on the reserve list for leading positions above the county level (Zhong 2003, 112). In January 2006, the central organization department of the Chinese Communist Party specifically emphasized that “the main body of chief party and government leaders at the county level should be around the age of 45” (Xin- hua News Agency 2006, 4). Even a county leader in his or her early 40s would have to try all out to be promoted as soon as possible lest he or she become too old to be eligible and ultimately end his or her political career at the county level. Therefore, the incentive to impress supe- riors with visible and quantifiable performance measures should peak at the point in a leader’s tenure when he or she is just about to be considered for promotion. After that, if the leader still stays in the same position without being promoted, his or her incentive should no longer grow with time. To be clear, other, noncyclical incentives may still persist for local officials to maintain high levels of spending even when promotion is out of the question, such as to use large, expensive projects to create rent- seeking opportunities for family members and friends (Ji 2006). It is actually no easy task to figure out after how many years in office a county leader is most likely to be consid- ered for promotion, and therefore the exact time when the incentiveforspendingisthehighest,eventhoughtherele- vant stipulations in party and state constitutions are clear and simple. According to Article 106 of the state constitu- tion and Article 26 of the party constitution, respectively, the term of office of the local territorial chief executives and party secretaries should all be five years. In practice, however, the observed term in office is often shorter than the constitutionally stipulated five years because county leaderscanleavetheirpostprematurelyforanyofavariety of reasons. Some are transferred to other counties, some retire because of old age or poor health, and some are removed following a corruption scandal. Especially the “ganbu yidi jiaoliu” (cadre exchange to other localities) system involved 96% of county party secretaries and 97% of county chief executives from 1995 to 2001 (Zhang and Shan 2001, 4). However, transfers, retirements, and perse- cution are normally beyond the control of county leaders and thus should not affect their incentive structure. What is within their control and part of their incentive is to ac- celerate government spending at the crucial point in the expected “normal” career path when the party commit- tees at upper levels are about to make personnel decisions concerning them. If the expected “normal” advancement cycle of a county leader’s political career generally cor- responds to the constitutionally stipulated term of five years, we would expect the incentive for accelerated gov- ernment spending to be the highest in the fourth year in office. Some might argue that because county leaders do not know in advance exactly when they may be rotated or replaced, they would not be able to time their budget cycles accordingly. However, what is being argued clearly here is that leaders can still act strategically even under that uncertainty. Later in this article the actual pattern of local leaders’ time in office in the empirical data may help shed some light on the formation of the leaders’ expectations.', metadata={'author': 'Gang Guo', 'year': '2009', 'title': 'China{\\\\textquotesingle}s Local Political Budget Cycles', 'journal': 'American Journal of Political Science'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CHINA’S LOCAL POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLES 625 Capacity for Local Political Budget Cycles While the incentives for strategically timed high growth in government spending clearly exist, another necessary condition for local political budget cycles is for local lead- ers in China actually to have sufficient control over lo- cal government spending. As a unitary system, China does not have a constitutionally guaranteed division of power between the central and local governments. How- ever, even during the Maoist era, as a central planned command economy, China was already a less centralized system than the former Soviet Union and other European socialist countries. Although there has been a recent de- bate about the causal link between decentralization and economic successes in the post-Mao reform era, both sides recognize the fact that substantial political and fiscal decentralization did take place (Cai and Treisman 2006; Jin, Qian, and Weingast 2005). As Figure 1 shows, the central government’s share of total expenditures hovered above 50% in the early 1980s, but has never surpassed 35% since 1988. In other words, the four subnational levels (province, prefecture/city, county/city district, and township) account for around 70% of total government expenditures. The 2008 budget ratified by the first ses- sion of the 11th National People’s Congress set the central FIGURE 1 Central Government’s Share in Total Revenues and Expenditures, 1953–2008 Data source: Ministry of Finance 2006, 2008. government expenditures at 1.3 trillion yuan, while sub- national governments are budgeted to spend 4.8 trillion yuan (Ministry of Finance 2008), which brings down the central government’s share in total government expendi- tures to the lowest level at least since 1953. Chinese local governments nowadays clearly assume an unprecedented large proportion of government spending responsibilities and day-to-day control over various economic activities. According to Professor Du Gangjian of the State School of Administration, “except for foreign affairs, military, and national defense, there is virtually no difference between the power that [county leaders] have and the power of the center” (Dong, Zhang, and Zhang 2005). Figure 1 also shows that on the revenue side, fiscal decentralization was reversed in 1994. In that year the Chinese government implemented a tax-sharing system reform that raised the central government’s share of total revenues to a level unprecedented since the Great Leap Forward while spending responsibilities remain highly decentralized. To make up for the discrepancy the cen- tral government more than quadrupled the amount of various subsidies to subnational governments from 54 billion yuan in 1993 to 239 billion yuan in 1994. Since then the central government’s subsidies have grown more than sevenfold, to a record 1.8 trillion yuan in 2007 (Min- istry of Finance 2008). The 1994 fiscal reform ushered in', metadata={'author': 'Gang Guo', 'year': '2009', 'title': 'China{\\\\textquotesingle}s Local Political Budget Cycles', 'journal': 'American Journal of Political Science'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='626 GANG GUO over a decade of ongoing institutional changes in China that have gradually subjected various local government functions to increasingly strict centralized supervision and vertical management (Mertha 2005, 801). The 1994 tax-sharing system reform itself “signaled a retreat from the emphasis on decentralization that had prevailed for more than a decade and was evidently a key element of the new focus on strengthening central control of the organizational hierarchy” (Yang 2004, 74). Those fiscal and institutional reforms have obviously put more constraints on the budgetary discretion of lo- cal leaders. However, those leaders should still have more than sufficient power and influence to implement politi- cal budget cycles, especially at the county level. First, the 1994 tax-sharing system reform never recentralized lo- cal government spending (Wong 2007, 16). Actually the central government’s share in total government expendi- tures even decreased from 30% in 1994 to less than 22% in the 2008 budget. Second, the ballooning central sub- sidies since the 1994 reform have not taken away local leaders’ discretion over budgetary spending. To be clear, a large part of subnational governments’ budgetary needs is now met by various subsidies from the central govern- ment.However,onlyasmallproportionofthosesubsidies are in the form of earmarked subsidies that can only be used for stipulated purposes such as infrastructure, pub- lic health, and so on. In 2003, for instance, only 19% of all central subsidies to subprovincial governments in China were earmarks (Ministry of Finance 2005, 7). Most central subsidies are lump-sum tax rebates or transfer payments with few strings attached as to the specific use by local governments. The scale and priorities of local government spending is still largely the responsibility of local leaders. Moreover, although local leaders do lobby diligently for more earmarks from upper-level govern- ments, most subsidies, such as tax rebates and general transfer payments, are based on predetermined formulas or amounts and thus immune from those lobbying efforts (Guo 2008, 76). Some might argue that county officials are spending more in some years because their superiors allow them to spend more. That is certainly true consid- ering the growing dependence of local governments since 1994onfiscaltransfersfromupperlevels,discussedearlier in this article. However, what is being argued clearly here is that is only part of the story and that growing quantity of subsidies does not necessarily take away local leaders’ budgetary spending authority. Therefore in the statistical analysis later in this article the effect of fiscal transfers will be controlled for. Finally, fiscal decentralization of expenditures never promoted public participation in or improved the transparency of local budgetary processes in China. Government budgets remain extremely general and sketchy, making a thorough examination impossible, and there is no legal sanction against the governments doing this (Yang 2004, 235). Moreover, local people’s con- gresses normally meet for only a few days in the spring, which is both too late and too short to supervise the local budget for that year. It should also be noted here that while the party sec- retary and the chief executive are the two top leaders in a county, they serve somewhat different roles. The sec- retary of the county party committee is clearly the “first hand” in a county, exerting especially political leadership and personnel control through the nomenklatura sys- tem over subordinate party and government cadres. The chief executive of a county is the top administrator in the county government who is in charge of the day-to-day management of government functions, such as agricul- ture, industry, education, etc. In terms of the retrospective economic accountability, both the party secretary and the chief executive should be subject to a similar set of evalua- tion criteria. The party secretary also benefits from visible performance measures and is therefore supportive of the chief executive’s effort, even if not necessarily making the expenditure allocations. Empirical Findings The previous two sections laid out the theoretical frame- work for local political budget cycles in China. The incen- tive for county leaders to accelerate government spending is expected to peak during the years when they are most likely to be considered for promotion. This theoretical prediction will be tested in this section using county- level panel data. The dependent variable is the annual growth rate of government expenditures per capita for each county each year. Five years of annual growth rates for each county are calculated from six years of statis- tics on county government expenditures and population from 1997 through 2002. These data are published in the China County (City) Social and Economic Statistical Year- books [Zhongguo xian (shi) shehui jingji tongji nianjian]. Since these are publicly available data compiled from local official reports, there may be concern about their reliabil- ity. While the incentive and capacity of local leaders to ex- aggerate statistics certainly exist, both have declined con- siderably due to a series of recentralization reform mea- sures since the 1990s that shifted horizontal, geographic lines of authority relations to vertical, functional lines (Mertha 2005). Through institutional reforms and new technologies, the central state capacity to measure, moni- tor, and audit local economic and fiscal activities has also', metadata={'author': 'Gang Guo', 'year': '2009', 'title': 'China{\\\\textquotesingle}s Local Political Budget Cycles', 'journal': 'American Journal of Political Science'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='CHINA’S LOCAL POLITICAL BUDGET CYCLES 627 improved dramatically (Yang 2004, 77). Another con- cern is that the substantial amount of extra-budgetary revenues and expenditures in Chinese counties are not reported in the yearbooks. However, given the incentive structure of local leaders, they would probably take ad- vantage of the extra-budgetary spending in much the same way as they do budgetary spending, that is, to help boost visible and quantifiable performance measures and thus to improve the prospect of their political career advancement. A priori the growth rate of government expendi- tures is more appropriate for the purpose of testing local political budget cycles than other measures such as the growth of agriculture, industry, or revenues. Compared with other variables, government spending is where the local leaders have the most immediate control and should be the most sensitive to any cyclical manipulation. Field research by Wang (2002, 8) reveals that county budget is controlled only by the two or three top leaders of a county. Economic growth rate in Chinese counties, which by of- ficial definition are all in the rural area, often depends on such factors as local weather conditions and national market prices, etc., that local leaders obviously have no control over. Local leaders also lack the monetary and other policy instruments to cause immediate economic growth, especially in the context of the significantly re- tracted economic role of the state during the reform era. The 1994 tax-sharing system reform also dramatically centralized the collection of value added tax and excise tax and has thus limited the power of local governments regarding tax revenues. The key explanatory variables for this model of po- litical budget cycle are how long the county party sec- retaries and chief executives have been in office, respec- tively. These variables are expected to have a curvilinear relationship with the dependent variable of expenditure growth. To calculate the values of these two key explana- tory variables, the names of the party secretaries and the chief executives of all counties of mainland China are ob- tained from the respective provincial yearbooks for the years from 1994 through 2002, except those in the Cen- trally Administered Municipality of Chongqing, in the province of Sichuan, and in the Autonomous Region of Tibet, which did not list county leaders’ names in their yearbooks. From those names a “time in office” variable was derived for each county each year that indicates for how many years the chief executive has been in office. For instance, if a county chief executive came to office in 1995, then this “time in office” variable would take on value of “1” for that county in 1995, value of “2” for that county in 1996, and value of “3” in 1997, and so on, un- til that chief executive leaves his or her position and the variable takes on value of “1” again. Likewise, a separate “time in office” variable was derived for the county party secretaries, which turns out to be highly correlated with the variable of time in office of the chief executives, at r = 0.5. The list of names of county leaders does not contain information about their age, sex, or prior experience, but at least five categories of outcomes in the following year for each chief executive can be derived from the list, namely, whether he or she stayed on the same job, became the chief executive of another county, became the party secretary in the same county, became the party secretary of another county, or left the position in some other unknown way, i.e., retirement, demotion, etc. For party secretaries, the information derivable from the list of names is much more limited than for chief executives, because while chief executives can be promoted to the position of party secretary and still be in the data set, a party secretary would disappear from the list of names once he or she is promoted. Besides, party secretaries are rarely transferred to be the party secretary of another county,letalonetobedemotedtobecomethecountychief executive. Table 1 shows the cross-tabulation between the timeinofficeandtheoutcomeinthefollowingyearforthe chief executives from 1998 through 2002. Table 2 shows the frequency distribution of chief executives’ time in office for each year from 1998 through 2002. Some interesting observations can be made here. First, relatively few counties have chief executives who have been in the position for more than six years, which indicates a rather frequent turnover among county lead- ers. Secondly, it is relatively rare for a newly installed chief executive to be replaced in the following year. The vast majority of county chief executives in their first or second year in office stayed in the same position in the following year. In contrast, most of the chief executives in their fifth year in office or later were replaced in one way or another. Generally speaking promotion to the po- sition of party secretary appears to be the most common mode of turnover for county chief executives. Especially noticeable are the fourth and fifth years in office of chief executives. One in every five county chief executives in their fourth or fifth year in office were promoted to be the party secretary of the same county in the following year, plus 3 or 4% who were promoted to be the party secretary of another county. Chief executives who were in earlier or later years in office did not seem to be pro- moted at such high frequencies.

Moreover, the main element of uncertainty here is the last category of outcomes, which includes all the other situations of official turnover, such as retirement or dismissal from all official posts, retirement to the lo- cal people’s congress or political consultative conference, promotion to a position other than that of a county party secretary, demotion, etc. It may be said here, however, with some empirically informed confidence, that county chief executives probably expect to have the best chance to be considered for promotion at around their fifth year in office and thus they probably have the strongest incentive to increase government spending about a year before that. Table 2 suggests that turnover rate of county chief executives did fluctuate from year to year, and so dummy variables for each year except the base year of 2000 are included in the model to control for, among other things, the possible effect of any nationally synchronized waves of local official turnovers. To capture the curvilinear rela- tionship between time in office and expenditure growth, both the “time in office” variable and its quadratic form are added to the equation. According to the discussion in the previous section, two of the most important deter- minants of local government expenditures are revenues and subsidies (i.e., intergovernmental transfer payments from above), and so the annual growth rates of county government revenues per capita and subsidies per capita are both in the model.

The cor- relation between the time-in-office variables for party secretaries and for chief executives is quite high, at 0.5, and so they probably should not be in the same equation.

Those help improve the prospect of local leaders being promoted, especially when it is done at the right time, that is, when the party committees at upper levels are about to make personnel decisions concerning them. The difference between the results for party secretaries and for chief executives is rather small. The party secre- taries may have a slightly shorter time horizon than chief executives. The mathematical peak for party secretaries lies closer to the third year than to the fourth year in of- fice, whereas the peak for chief executives lies closer to the fourth year than to the third year. That may indicate that the turnover of county chief executives is somewhat more institutionally constrained by the five-year cycle of the people’s congress system and by the state constitu- tion while the mobility of party secretaries is entirely the party’s internal affair. Also of interest is that expenditure growth in 2001, and to a somewhat lesser extent in 2002, is significantly higher than in other years. As 2002 and 2003 were the years of local people’s congress and party congress elec- tions in many areas and thus of particularly high turnover oflocalofficials,probablycountyleadersweredeliberately accelerating spending in 2001 and 2002 in anticipation of the scheduled turnover in 2002 and 2003. On the other hand, it is equally plausible, and probably even more in- teresting, that the observed surge in county government expenditures in 2001 and 2002 could be part of a nation- ally coordinated political budget cycle in preparation for the 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party in 2002 and the 10th National People’s Congress in 2003,whentheso-calledfourth-generationleaders,ledby Hu Jintao, were set to replace the third-generation leaders led by Jiang Zemin. As local people’s congress elections were not synchronized across the country until 2006, it would be interesting to see whether this finding holds for later time series, especially the years of 2005 and 2006, when county governments in 14 and 17 provinces, respec- tively, in late 2006 and early 2007 are scheduled to start a new five-year term while no top leadership turnover is expected to happen (Gong 2007). Moreover, the analysis in this article could certainly be further strengthened by extending the panel data back in time as well as to more recent years when official county statistics for more years become available in machine-readable form. Conclusion While the literature on political business cycles has prolif- erated, few studies have explored, either theoretically or empirically, the subject of local political budget cycles in the absence of competitive elections. This article attempts to take part in the first steps at filling that important gap in the existing literature by investigating local cases in China. Despite the fundamentally different institutional context than that in a democracy, local leaders in China also have the incentive and capacity to manipulate gov- ernment spending at crucial points during their tenure to improve the prospect of political advancement. Politi- cal budget cycles in this setting are driven by the familiar personal concerns over political career under incomplete information and assisted by the economic and fiscal de- centralization of the post-Mao era. It should be pointed out, however, that in the absence of downward account- ability of local leaders the mass public is probably not the main beneficiary of the surge in government spending. A folk rhyme widely cited in Chinese media says, “Money wasspent,projectswerebuilt,leaderswerepromoted,and the people suffered” (The Beijing News 2006, A02). More analyses on the policy outcomes of local political bud- get cycles in China will undoubtedly open up important avenues for future research. The implications of this study are mainly twofold. On one hand, the findings suggest that the political mo- bility of Chinese cadres may be more institutionalized and based on their actual performance than in the pop- ular perception. In a survey of township cadres in An- hui province, over two-thirds of the respondents believed that official promotion is based on personal connections (Zhong 2003, 115). Personal connections are certainly es- sential, but if that is the whole story why would county leaders bother to strategically time a surge in govern- ment spending during the crucial point in their tenure? On the other hand, the consequent acceleration of ex- penditures may not have been the initial intention of the regime and has generated increasingly sharp criti- cisms. The Chinese official media and national leaders often deplore local governments’ fiscal indiscipline and extravagant spending projects. On October 28, 2007, the National People’s Congress passed the Urban and Rural Planning Law, which was specifically designed to curb the so-called “zhengji” (political achievement) projects of lo- cal governments (Zhang and Du 2007). However, without a fundamental change in the incentive structure and fiscal capacity of local leaders, such phenomena are unlikely to ebb away.

Long- run growth depends not only on emission ﬂows but also on the assimilative capacity of the environment. The importance of environmental protection has brought emissions reductions to the awareness of policy makers in many developing countries. However, emissions reductions are usually tied to short-run growth cuts. In developing countries, where economic growth has been the focus, how can local bureaucrats be motivated to implement an emission control policy, and how would it aﬀect economic growth? This paper investigates how local bureaucrats respond to a performance evaluation system targeting emissions control in China. China has been the fastest-growing major economy over the past three decades, but this growth has come at the cost of heavy environmental pollution.1 The central government realized the pressing environmental issues and proposed a major policy initiative in 1998 to establish control zones in regions with the highest levels of sulfur emissions or acid rain. The main objective of the Two 1Twelve of the twenty most polluted cities in the world are located in China, and only 1% of the country’s 560 million city dwellers breathe air considered safe by the European Union (World Bank, 2007). The total economic cost of China’s air pollution was assessed at 4.1% of the GDP in 2002 (Wen and Chen, 2008), and the total economic loss of water and air pollution was evaluated at nearly 6.9% of the GDP in 2003 based on the willingness to pay approach (World Bank, 2007). China consistently ranks in the bottom quintile for ambient air quality according to the World Health Organization.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Control Zones (hereafter, TCZ) policy was to reduce SO2 emissions, which have long been a major contributor to China’s ambient air pollution.2 Contrary to the initial policy design, the eﬀect of the TCZ policy on SO2 emissions reductions was small and temporary. After a short dip in 1998-1999, SO2 emissions con- tinued to rise and reached a historical high in 2005-2006 (see Fig. 1).3 The unsuccessful implementation of the TCZ policy led the central government to reconsider its strategy. In 2005, new administrative regulations were imposed, and the emissions quota was in- cluded in the performance evaluation system for top local bureaucrats (city mayors and Party secretaries), making them subject to administrative sanction or removal from of- ﬁce if the quota was not met. This new administrative enforcement was the ﬁrst time that an emissions quota was included in the performance evaluation system and brought signiﬁcant changes to the lives of these local bureaucrats. [Insert Figure 1 here] For empirical analysis, we collected a rich set of data on 286 prefectural cities, among which 162 are TCZ cities and the rest are non-TCZ cities, and implement a diﬀerence-in- diﬀerences (DD) identiﬁcation framework. We ﬁnd that TCZ prefectural cities exhibited a similar pattern of reduction in SO2 emissions before 2005 compared to the control group (non-TCZ cities). After SO2 reductions became part of the performance measures in 2005, however, we ﬁnd that TCZ cities experience larger emissions reductions as they face more stringent reduction goals. In the meantime, we also ﬁnd that the gross domestic product (GDP) growth rates in TCZ cities signiﬁcantly decreased compared to that of the control group after the policy change. These results imply that the new evaluation system in 2005 introduced a substantial trade-oﬀ between SO2 emissions and GDP growth. A back of envelope calculation shows that for every 1 tonne of reduction in industrial SO2 emissions at city level, it’s GDP would be reduced by 190 thousand Chinese Yuan.4 A further welfare analysis suggests that the focal policy led to 833 lives saved, which is valued at 487.3 million in 1997 Chinese Yuan based on the World Bank’s valuation of a statistical life. The fact that the cost of the program exceeds its beneﬁt suggests that the Chinese government is willing to pay a premium for immediate and sizable reductions in 2The ambient concentration of SO2 in many Chinese cities was among the highest in the world when China’s coal consumption peaked in 1995. The damage from acid rain in the early 1990s was estimated to be about 0.7% of the GDP (World Bank, 1997). 3In Appendix Figure A.1, we further plot the time trends of SO2 emissions for TCZ and non-TCZ cities, respectively. However, due to the data availability, we can only start the analysis from 2001 onward (for data details, see Section 3.2). We ﬁnd similar upward increasing trends of SO2 emissions for TCZ and non-TCZ cities before 2005. After 2005, SO2 emissions stagnated in non-TCZ cities but declined in TCZ cities. 4To put this number into perspective, in 1999 the average emission charge on industrial SO2 at the national level was 46.37 Chinese Yuan per tonne (He, 2005). 2', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Our results are robust to a battery of speciﬁcation checks, such as a placebo test with a random assignment of TCZ cities, an alternative measurement of pollution reduction, a check on spatial spillover, the inclusion of a regional aggregate linear trend, a combination of DD and propensity score matching (PSM), the inclusion of time-varying controls, and the exclusion of large cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), as well as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities. To shed light on the substitution of eﬀorts between pollution reduction and economic development, we analyze the channels through which the policy was at work. In particu- lar, we closely examine the actual policies implemented by local bureaucrats in order to reduce SO2 emissions. By using detailed plant-level data from the electric power sector, we ﬁnd that most of the measures for reducing SO2 emissions were enforced by local bureaucrats, which explains the signiﬁcant drop in SO2 emissions in TCZ cities after 2005 compared with non-TCZ cities. Meanwhile, some of these measures (such as the closure and establishment restrictions on thermal power plants, control of growth in dirty sectors, etc.) had negative implications for economic development.5 We then conduct a thorough content analysis of each city government’s Annual Work of the Government Report from 2001 to 2015 to investigate how local bureaucrats revealed their eﬀorts for pollution reduction and economic growth. We ﬁnd that TCZ city governments became more concerned about environmental protection but had lower target GDP growth rates after 2005 than non-TCZ city governments. These results further indicate that local bureaucrats in TCZ cities were willing to trade oﬀ GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal. Our ﬁndings contribute to the literature in several ways. First, our paper adds new empirical evidence to the economics literature on incentivizing bureaucrats with concrete performance targets. Public management literature has long been trying to understand the eﬀect of a concrete performance target on the behaviors of local bureaucrats (OECD, 1994; Hood, 2007). In the economics literature, mixed evidence has been generated in previous studies. Lockwood and Porcelli (2013) show that the comprehensive perfor- mance assessment system in England has increased public service quality but has no signiﬁcant eﬀect on eﬃciency overall. Recent studies in Nigeria (Rasul and Rogger, 2015, 2017) suggest that concrete targets tend to decrease public service delivery.6 Our paper 5A dirty sector is deﬁned by matching the 2-digit industry classiﬁcation code to that of major SO2 pollution sectors identiﬁed by the China Pollution Source Census 2007. The 2007 census, the only pollution source census in China up to this date, examined 5.92 million pollution sources across all provinces in China. The ﬁnal report identiﬁed six industries (as shown in Appendix Table A.1) that rank the highest in terms of SO2 emissions share in total industrial SO2 emissions. These six industries comprise 88.5% of total SO2 industrial emissions. 6The failure of performance-based incentives is usually attributed to the multi-task nature of bureau- cratic jobs and bureaucrats’ intrinsic motives (Dixit, 2002; Alesina and Tabellini, 2008).

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT provides empirical evidence for the eﬀectiveness of a concrete performance target in an environmental regulation setting. In particular, our results suggest that a target-based evaluation system can be eﬀective in motivating bureaucrats to shift their eﬀorts to- ward the tasks that are more heavily weighted by the evaluators and seek to achieve the targeted policy output. The magnitude of our estimates also suggests that bureaucrats appear to be willing to trade oﬀ substantial GDP growth for SO2 emissions reduction. Our paper adds to the understanding of multitasking agency problems for government agents. Career concern theories suggest that top bureaucrats are largely driven by the outcomes of their mandated tasks (Holmstrom and Milgrom, 1991; Dewatripont et al., 1999; Alesina and Tabellini, 2007, 2008). Under this framework, bureaucrats choose their eﬀort levels and their distribution of eﬀorts across tasks to maximize their signaled capa- bility to the market (or the principal). Speciﬁcally, our results speak to two theoretical predictions made by Wilson (1989), Dewatripont et al. (1999) and Dewatripont et al. (2000). The ﬁrst prediction is that bureaucrats’ accountability increases as their mis- sion becomes more “focused”and “clear”. Compared to the initial establishment of the TCZ in 1998, the new administrative policy in 2005 brought more clarity to the local bureaucrats’ mission agenda. And this narrowly deﬁned goal increases eﬀorts exerted by bureaucrats for controlling emissions. Our results support this prediction by show- ing that local bureaucrats implemented a series of policies that speciﬁcally targeted SO2 emissions reduction after the administrative enforcement. The second prediction that relates to our results is that when eﬀort is encouraged on one task, eﬀorts on other tasks would decrease. Our results show that compared to non-TCZ cities, real GDP growth signiﬁcantly decreases in TCZ cities after the new administrative policy was in place in 2005, indicating a shift of attention from GDP growth to emissions control by local bureaucrats. Our paper addresses an important yet relatively neglected topic in the environmental economics literature for developing countries - the empirical relationship between strin- gent environmental regulations and GDP growth. The eﬀect of environmental regulations on growth mainly stems from three channels. The ﬁrst is the direct cost of regulations. For example, in 2015, the total government expenditure on environmental protection among the European Union member countries amounted to 0.4% of the GDP (EuroStat, 2017), and the Chinese government designated 7.5 billion U.S. dollars for environmental protection in 2017 (MEPC, 2017). Diverting government resources towards enforcement and compliance of environmental regulations would potentially hurt economic growth. Secondly, regulations might lead to shutdowns of certain plants and thus unemployment. usually juggle multiple tasks or multiple dimensions of a task, concrete performance targets potentially cause social distortion by requiring bureaucrats to exert eﬀort on less productive outcomes (Rasul and Rogger, 2017). Emphasizing output as a performance measure would also likely crowd out the intrinsic motivations for bureaucrats (Benabou and Tirole, 2003). 4', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Empirical evidence in the U.S. suggests that stringent regulations result in signiﬁcant job loss in both the short and long run (Greenstone, 2012; Walker, 2013). The third channel is ﬁrm competitiveness. Conventional economic theories suggest that, at the ﬁrm level, stringent environmental regulations result in the relocation of resources from more pro- ductive activities to pollution abatement, and they decrease productivity (Xepapadeas, 2005). The opposite view, as suggested by Porter and van der Linde (1995), argues that in the long run, improved eﬃciency and innovation might increase productivity due to technological enhancements.7 Empirical literature on the relationship between en- vironmental regulations and economic growth is rather limited in developing countries. Existing studies usually focus on estimating regulations’ impacts on ﬁrm competitiveness (Yuan et al., 2017; Wang and Shen, 2016; Zhao et al., 2015). At the aggregate level, less is known about the impact on economic growth. Our results address this gap by directly estimating the eﬀect of a stringent environmental regulation on GDP growth. We show that bringing a SO2 emissions cut to the performance evaluation system leads to a 0.846 percentage point drop in GDP growth per annum.8 Our results indicate that the impact of environmental regulations on GDP growth can be both signiﬁcant and long lasting. Our ﬁndings also contribute to the small but growing literature on what motivates local governments to adopt more stringent environmental policies. Rigor and willing- ness to implement environmental regulation at the local government level are usually associated with political connections, promotion probability and other political concerns (Zheng et al., 2014; Jin and Lin, 2014; Kahn et al., 2015).9 Our paper shows that the readiness of the central government to reward and punish local oﬃcials based on their environmental performance could also motivate local government oﬃcials to reach the green goal.10 The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a review of the policy background on the TCZ policy and performance evaluation system. We 7Empirical studies have provided inclusive evidence for the Porter Hypothesis. For example, a recent meta-analysis, which was conducted by Cohen and Tubb (2017), showed that environmental regulations display heterogeneous impact on productivity at the ﬁrm and industrial level. The impact size was signiﬁcantly correlated with the types of regulations imposed. 8To put this number into perspective, Jorgenson and Wilcoxen (1990) showed that the aggregate impact of environmental regulation on U.S. economic growth in the 1980s was about 0.191 percentage point. 9Zheng et al. (2014) show that a city mayor’s environmental performance is related to his or her promotion probability. Jin and Lin (2014) focus on explaining the relationship between political con- nections and environmental pollution. She suggests that local governments are possibly motivated by their environmental concerns. Kahn et al. (2015) study the behavior of local governments when they are incentivized to reduce water pollution and provide a mechanism that can resolve cross-border pollution. Our paper focuses on evaluating the impact of a public management incentive system. Although all these papers address environmental pollution and promotion in China, the research questions and focus are very diﬀerent. 10Our results complement and echo the literature evaluating the target-based vertical control system (see Xu (2011) for a review). 5', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Mechanisms and welfare analyses are presented in sections 5 and 6. 2. Policy background 2.1. Administrative Enforcement of SO2 Reductions Targets SO2 emissions have long been a major contributor to China’s ambient air pollution, and reducing SO2 emissions has been a priority for China’s environmental authorities since the 1990s. Beginning with the 9th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 1996 to 2000) in 1996, China’s central government began to set limits on total SO2 emissions. In 1998, the State Council instituted an SO2 reduction program (henceforth referred to as the 1998 policy) to limit ambient SO2 pollution and to curb the growing incidence of acid rain. The 1998 policy encompassed two target policy areas: the SO2 Control Zone, covering cities in North China, and the Acid Rain Control Zone, covering cities in South China. In aggregate, the TCZ regions cover 11% of China’s territory (see Fig. 2) and are responsible for more than 60% of China’s total SO2 emissions.11 The 1998 policy also laid out long- term SO2 emissions reduction goals. Speciﬁcally, it stated that by 2000, SO2 emissions from TCZ cities should be under the quota set by the central government.12 By 2010, SO2 emissions should not be higher than 2000 levels, and air quality in major TCZ cities needs to meet the national standard by 2010 (SO2 air concentration below 60 µg/m3). To reach the total SO2 emissions reduction targets (also known as the green goal ), the Chinese central government imposed nationwide emissions quotas in 2000, with more stringent measures applied to TCZ cities. A total emissions control policy was incorporated into China’s 10th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 2001 to 2005) in 2001 to work in concert with the TCZ policy.13 [Insert Figure 2 here] However, the implementation of the TCZ policy was not successful. The eﬀect of the TCZ policy on SO2 emissions reductions was small and temporary. Although total SO2 emissions leveled oﬀ between 1997 and 2002, they quickly picked up speed afterward. By 2005, the total emissions level had not declined but instead, had increased by 28% from the 2000 level (see Fig. 1). To force localities to adhere to the national policy, administrative enforcement was put into place by the end of 2005 (henceforth also referred to as the 2005 policy) as part of the 11th Five-Year Plan (i.e., from 2006 to 2010). Starting in Dec 2005, local 11The relevant Chinese document for the TCZ policy is available at the following government website: http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/wj/200910/t20091022_172231.htm 12The actual SO2 emissions in 1995 was 23.7 million tons.

A follow- up announcement was made by the central government in 2007 speciﬁcally about the emissions reductions targets, which emphasized that the SO2 emissions reduction targets to be attained by the end of 2010 would be incorporated into the responsibility contracts signed with upper-level governments. After the central government imposed the administrative enforcement at the end of 2005, the central government’s consistent emphasis on the need to reduce SO2 emissions has made it incrementally more diﬃcult for local governments and polluters to drag their feet in carrying out the central government’s SO2 emissions reduction policy. By 2010, the SO2 emissions reduction targets were ﬁnally met, and an overall 14.29% reduction was achieved nationwide (see Fig. 1). The target-based performance system was carried through the 12th Five-Year Plan (i.e., 2011-2015) and by 2015, a further national total SO2 emissions reduction target of 8% was also achieved. 2.2. SO2 emissions reductions and career concerns In this subsection, we discuss a conceptual framework and present descriptive evidence for the link between the target-based performance evaluation system and emissions reduc- tions. Following the seminal work by Dewatripont et al. (1999) and Alesina and Tabellini (2008), bureaucrats are partly motivated by their career concerns. Speciﬁcally, career concern theories suggest that top bureaucrats are largely driven by the outcomes of their mandated tasks. Under this framework, bureaucrats choose their eﬀort levels and their distribution of eﬀorts across tasks to maximize their signaled capability to the non-public sectors. In addition to career motives, studies show that bureaucrats are motivated by peer pressure, social norms and bureaucrats’ own glow of warmth (Wilson, 1989; Maskin and Tirole, 2004). In China, the most important career concern for bureaucrats is to move up the hierar- 14The relevant Chinese document is available at the following government website: http://www.gov.cn/zwgk/2005-12/13/content 125680.htm 15In the meantime, the central government banned new construction projects in regions with un- satisfactory SO2 emissions reductions, in an eﬀort to align incentives for economic growth with local governments’ achievement of the green goal. Given that the achievement rate of the SO2 emissions tar- get was very high (i.e., 98% for the TCZ cities; see Table 1), the policy was not binding. Nonetheless, to alleviate the concern that our estimates may be caused by the banning of new construction projects, we conduct a robustness check by including the logarithm of ﬁxed investment per capita in Appendix Table A.2, column 1. We ﬁnd that our estimates are robust to this control, further suggesting that our results are not aﬀected by the banning policy. 7', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

To signal their ability to the upper level supervisors, bureaucrats need to know the most important task and weights evaluated by the supervisor. Since the economic reform in the 1970s, the central government has been incentivizing local governments to “get rich ﬁrst.” The GDP growth has been the most important evaluation criterion for local bureaucrats in China. Empirical evidence suggests that the promotions and bonuses of local bureaucrats are highly correlated with regional GDP growth (e.g., Li and Zhou, 2005). The 2005 policy was the ﬁrst time that a pollution emissions quota was explicitly men- tioned in the performance evaluation criteria. Given that this policy contained signiﬁcant measures for promotion, SO2 emissions reductions became one of the most important fac- tors in the assessment of local cadres.16 Local government leaders who fail to meet the annual SO2 emissions reduction targets would be penalized with an administrative sanc- tion or removal from oﬃce.17 The administrative enforcement ensures the eﬀectiveness of the TCZ policy across the chessboard of China’s territorial administration, and further ties local cadres to their fulﬁllment of the target SO2 emissions reductions. Table 1 presents the emissions reductions goals for the 11th (i.e., from 2006 to 2010) and 12th Five-Year Plans (i.e., from 2011 to 2015), as well as the average achievement rate. We present the numbers for TCZ and non-TCZ cities, separately. The information was compiled by the authors from various government documents to cover as many cities in our sample as possible. Note that although the reduction goals for TCZ cities are much more aggressive than those for non-TCZ cities, the achievement rates are much higher in TCZ cities. The average achievement rate for TCZ cities has remained at 98% since 2005. We cannot provide direct evidence for the link between removal from oﬃce with failing to achieve emissions reduction goals, as local bureaucrats could be removed from oﬃce for multiple reasons (corruption, scandals etc.). However, anecdotal evidence suggests that the veto power mentioned in the policy was eﬀective. For example, during a press release conference held by the State Council Information Oﬃce, a government oﬃcial mentioned that the veto power is a signal from the central government that pollution control is no longer a hand-waving gesture but something the government really cares about. It is also 16Other important performance measures for local bureaucrats include GDP growth, implementation of the One Child Policy and fatal accidents etc.. GDP growth has been shown to be highly correlated with promotions and bonuses for local bureaucrats (Chen et al., 2005). Fatal accidents as a measure of performance were ﬁrst brought up in a provision issued by the central government in 2001, which declared that “when an extremely fatal accident happens, the local government oﬃcials would be penalized based on the severity of the accident.”This measure is important because it is tied to the economic development and stability of society that the Party has been trying to achieve. The One Child Policy has been declared as the “basic state policy” since the late 1970s and was closely tied to performance evaluations of local bureaucrats (Feng et al., 2013). 17The relevant Chinese document is available at the following government website: http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2007-06/03/content 634545.htm 8', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

To achieve the emissions reductions goals set by the Five- Year plans, local bureaucrats weigh the pollution reduction against GDP growth. In the following sections, we formally investigate and quantify the eﬀect of the target-based performance evaluation system in the 2005 policy on emissions reductions and economic growth. Meanwhile, we also conduct a welfare analysis of the policy. 3. Estimation strategy 3.1. Estimation framework To investigate whether the performance-based evaluation system based on SO2 emis- sions reduction introduced in 2005 aﬀects government oﬃcials’ behavior in implementing environmental regulations and promoting economic growth, we conduct a DD analysis by comparing outcomes in TCZ cities (those cities with strict environmental regulations) iswith those of non-TCZ cities before and after 2005. Speciﬁcally, our regression equation yct = βTCZc ∗ Post05t + δc + γt + Zc ∗ f(t) + εct, (1) where yct contains our outcomes of concern (logarithm of the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate) in city c at year t; TCZc equals 1 if city c was designated a TCZ city in 1998 and 0 otherwise; Post05t takes a value of 1 if t > 2005 and 0 otherwise; δc is the city ﬁxed eﬀect, capturing all time-invariant diﬀerences across cities; γt is year ﬁxed eﬀect, capturing all yearly factors that are common to cities such as macro-level shocks; Zc denotes the determinants of TCZ selection measured in the pre-treatment period and f(t) is a third-order polynomial function (both explained later); and εct is the error term. To accommodate potential heteroskadesticity and serial correlation, we cluster the standard errors at the city level, following the suggestion by Bertrand et al. (2004). We expect β to be negative for the outcome of SO2 emissions (in the logarithm) if the performance-based evaluation system is eﬀective, as TCZ cities were subject to a larger emissions reductions target in 2000. Thus the new evaluation system introduced in 2005 would induce more reductions in TCZ cities. Meanwhile, we also expect β to be negative for the GDP growth rate as after the 2005 policy, local bureaucrats would reallocate eﬀorts 18The relevant interview information is available at http://www.scio.gov.cn/xwfbh/xwbfbh/wqfbh/ 2007/1129/Document/324843/324843.htm 9', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT from promoting growth to reducing pollution given the substantial career consequences of the policy.19 However, the unbiased estimation of β requires that the logarithm of SO2 emissions and GDP growth in TCZ cities would have followed the same time trend as those in non- TCZ cities after 2005 if a performance-based evaluation system had not been imposed by the central government in 2005. A primary threat to our identifying assumption is that cities were not randomly selected into TCZ and non-TCZ groups in 1998. This non-random selection implies that TCZ and non-TCZ cities could have been systemati- cally diﬀerent before 1998. If the values of these unobserved diﬀerences changed in 2005, then our estimate would be biased. To address this concern, we follow an approach used by Gentzkow (2006), in which key determinants of the TCZ selection are ﬁrst identi- ﬁed and then post-treatment variations in the outcome variable generated by these key determinants are ﬂexibly controlled in the regression. The premise of this approach is that conditional on these key determinants, the central government did not select TCZ cities based on remaining unobservables with a perspective that there would be a new performance-based evaluation system eight years later and these remaining unobservables would behave diﬀerently for TCZ and non-TCZ cities at that time. Given that the designation of TCZ cities was initiated by the central government in the mid-1990s, we look at government policy documents to understand the factors that shaped the government’s decision-making processes for selecting TCZ cities. Speciﬁcally, according to the Air Pollution Prevention and Control Law (APPCL) amended in 1995, based on conditions in the atmosphere, terrain and soil, cities could be designated as either an SO2 Control Zone or an Acid Rain Control Zone. In addition, the 1998 TCZ policy classiﬁed those cities that were already seriously polluted by SO2 or acid rain as TCZ cities. We collected two sets of variables as our TCZ selection variables. The ﬁrst set of variables reﬂects the conditions of the natural environment based on the 1995 APPCL amendment: Roughness (the standard deviation of slope), Elevation (average elevation in kilometers), Wind Speed (annual average wind speed in 1990-1995), Precipitation (an- nual average precipitation in 1990-1995) and Soil pH (average pH level of topsoil). The second set of variables reﬂects pre-policy SO2 pollution levels, which include Coldness (percentage of days with a temperature of 5oC or below in 1990-1995) and the total employment in dirty sectors in 1996.20 To ﬂexibly control for trends in SO2 emissions 19Policies implemented that target SO2 emissions reduction would also induce a mechanical trade-oﬀ between emissions and GDP growth. 20Ideally we should include pre-policy SO2 levels as a determinant for TCZ designation for each city, but unfortunately, the data are not available. Therefore, we use pollutants that are known to be highly correlated with SO2 and employees in the dirty sector as a proxy for baseline SO2 (see footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors.). When the daily outdoor temperature drops to 5◦C or below for a few days, the northern region of China enters the heating period. As a result, coal combustion in boilers is associated with the release of air pollutants that are highly correlated with SO2. 10', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

It is possible that the implementation of the TCZ policy itself could have altered the characteristics of the treatment and control groups so that they became incomparable when the target-based evaluation system was in place by the end of 2005. Speciﬁcally, existing studies have shown that the implementation of the TCZ policy in 1998 aﬀected foreign investment (Cai et al., 2016), exports (Hering and Poncet, 2014) and health (Tanaka, 2015). To address this concern, we add a set of variables that are known in the literature to be aﬀected by the TCZ policy: speciﬁcally, city-level foreign direct investment (FDI), mortality and export sales data, interacted with Post05.21 Appendix Table A.3 shows the balancing between TCZ and non-TCZ cities to shed light on whether controlling for TCZ selection variables improves the matching between our treatment and control groups. Panel A shows the seven selection variables. We ﬁnd that TCZ and non-TCZ cities diﬀered signiﬁcantly in many of these variables, such as the percentage of days with a temperature of 5oC or below in 1990-1995, annual wind speed in 1990-1995, total employment in dirty sectors in 1996, and annual average precipitation in 1990-1995. Panel B compares TCZ and non-TCZ cities on various economic and social development variables in the ﬁrst year in our sample (i.e., 2001).22 We ﬁnd that without controlling for TCZ selection variables, there were signiﬁcant diﬀerences in initial con- ditions between TCZ and non-TCZ cities. However, once conditional on TCZ selection variables, the diﬀerences becomes statistically and economically insigniﬁcant. These re- sults indicate that our treatment and control groups are balanced with the controls of TCZ selection variables, which is crucial for our identiﬁcation. As further checks on our identifying assumption in equation 1, we conduct several sen- sitivity exercises, including an event study of whether the outcome variables had similar pre-treatment trends between TCZ and non-TCZ cities, a placebo test with the random assignment of TCZ cities, an alternative measurement of pollution reduction, a check on spatial spillover, the inclusion of the regional aggregate linear trend, a combination of DD and PSM, the inclusion of time-varying controls, and the exclusion of large cities (such as Beijing, Shanghai, etc.) as well as the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities.

Data before 2001 were subject to signiﬁcant missing values, and thus were not included in the study. The city-level annual industrial SO2 emissions were calculated by summing up emissions from all reporting ﬁrms in a given year. The State Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) records each reporting ﬁrm’s SO2 emissions through direct monitoring. If direct monitoring is not feasible, the SEPA uses reverse engineering measures computed from the industrial waste reported by the ﬁrm. The list of reporting ﬁrms is determined by the SEPA and covers more than 85% of the major polluting ﬁrms in the city, and is subject to minor revisions each year. The monitoring process follows a strict protocol and is subject to internal auditing processes. It is very unlikely that the data were systemically manipulated via collusion between SEPA oﬃcials and local bureaucrats.

We then aggregate the export value from the 8-digit HS-product level to the 2-digit industry and city levels. 23According to the China Pollution Source Census 2007, industrial activity is responsible for 91.4% of total SO2 emissions.

Main results 4.1. Baseline estimates Table 3 reports the main results from equation 1. Column 1 presents results from a simple DD estimation for SO2 emissions with only the city and year ﬁxed eﬀects included. The interaction between TCZc and Post05t is negative and statistically signiﬁcant, sug- gesting that SO2 emissions fell more signiﬁcantly in TCZ cities than in non-TCZ cities after 2005. Given that the TCZ policy imposed stricter regulations on SO2 emissions in TCZ cities than in non-TCZ cities, and that a performance-based evaluation system was imposed in 2005, this result implies that the new evaluation system has disciplined or incentivized bureaucrats to enforce the environmental regulations. [Insert Table 3 here] To alleviate the concern that our estimate is biased due to the non-random selection of TCZ cities in 1998, we include interactions between determinants of TCZ selection and a third-order polynomial function of time in column 2. We continue to ﬁnd a neg- ative and statistically signiﬁcant estimate of TCZc ∗ Post05t. In column 3, we further include three interactions between Y ear05t and FDI, mortality and dirty export sales, respectively, to address the concern that the TCZ policy in 1998 made TCZ and non-TCZ cities non-comparable before 2005. We continue to ﬁnd a negative and statistically signif- icant coeﬃcient. In Appendix Table A.2, column 2, we estimate the policy eﬀect on the level of SO2 emissions, and uncover a negative coeﬃcient, despite the lack of statistical signiﬁcance due to the large standard errors. In columns 4 to 6, Table 3, we examine the eﬀect of the new performance evaluation system on GDP growth. Column 4 reports estimation from the baseline DD with only the city and year ﬁxed eﬀects. Columns 5 and 6 report results when more controls are included. We ﬁnd negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcients of the interaction between TCZc and Post05t across all speciﬁcations. These results indicate that the new evaluation system has led to a signiﬁcant decrease in economic growth. Economic magnitude. To gauge the economic signiﬁcance of our estimates, we report the control means in Table 3.

Given that the control mean of the logarithm of SO2 emissions is 1.338 (which implies a level of SO2 emissions as 3.811 with a unit of 10,000 tonnes), our estimate suggests that the policy leads to a decrease in SO2 emissions by 3.811 × 0.146 × 10000 = 5, 564 tonnes. For the GDP growth rate, our estimate in column 6 shows that the policy reduces the GDP growth rate by 0.846 percentage point. With the control mean of annual growth rate at 12.17%, this number suggests that the 2005 policy reduced the annual GDP growth rate by 0.846/12.17 = 6.9%. 4.2. Robustness checks Our estimates hinge on the identifying assumption that cities designated to be a TCZ in 1997 would not have had diﬀerential trends in SO2 emissions or GDP growth starting in 2005. To further verify that our identifying assumption is sustained, in this section, we report a battery of robustness checks. Time trends before the treatment. A necessary condition for satisfying our identifying assumption is that TCZ and non-TCZ cities have similar time trends in the outcomes before the treatment. Speciﬁcally, if similar time trends existed for a long period before the treatment and diverged after the treatment, it may indicate that the diﬀerential trends may be caused by the treatment. To this end, we apply an event study approach along the lines described by Jacobson et al. (1993). Speciﬁcally, we estimate the following equation yct = 2015 � t=2001 βtTCZc ∗ γt + δc + γt + Zc ∗ f(t) + εct, (2) in which βt is a series of estimates from 2001 to 2015. In particular, with the omitted time category being 2005, {βt} captures the diﬀerences in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities relative to the diﬀerence just before the policy launch. Fig. 3a plots the estimates for the outcome of SO2 reduction along with the 95% conﬁdence interval. We ﬁnd that the estimates are positive and are stable in the magni- tudes from 2001 to 2004, suggesting a common trend between TCZ and non-TCZ cities before the treatment. The estimates for the GDP growth rate are plotted in Fig. 3b. Despite some ﬂuctuations, all the estimates were positive from 2001 to 2004 without a clear trend. [Insert Figures 3a and 3b here] Figs 3a and 3b also allow us to visualize the marginal eﬀect of the 2005 policy by year. In Fig 3a, the diﬀerence dropped to negative immediately after the adoption of the treatment in 2005 and continued to be negative with increasing magnitude. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the policy change in 2005 generated the diﬀerential 14', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

In Fig. 3b, interestingly, the estimates for 2006 and 2007 were also positive and similar in magnitude to those in the pre-treatment period, and they became negative since 2008. These results suggest some lagging eﬀects of the 2005 policy change on the GDP growth rate. A placebo test with randomization of the treatment. As a second robustness check, we randomly draw 162 cities out of the total of 286 cities in our sample and assign TCZ status TCZfalse c to these cities. Similarly, we randomly assign the timing of the adoption of the new performance-based evaluation system Postfalse t to these cities, and then construct a new regressor of interest TCZfalse c × Postfalse t . Given this random data-generating process, a necessary condition for satisfying our identifying assumption is that TCZfalse c ×Postfalse t shall produce zero policy eﬀect on the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate; otherwise, it indicates that our estimation equation is misspeciﬁed. To increase the power of this test, we conduct the random assignment 1,000 times. The distributions of 1,000 estimated coeﬃcients for the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate are plotted in Appendix Figures A.2(a) and A.2(b), respectively. Both distributions are narrowly centered around zero, and less than 1% of the estimates are more negative than our true baseline estimates in Table 3. These graphs provide further support for our identiﬁcation strategy.25 Inclusion of regional linear time trend. To control for the aggregate time trend, we insert the regional linear time trend in our baseline equation (1), i.e., λr × t, where the regions include Northeast, East, Central and West China. Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 1, with panel A for SO2 emissions and panel B for the GDP growth rate. We ﬁnd consistent estimates, suggesting that our estimates are not aﬀected by the aggregate trends. [Insert Table 4 here] Exclusion of large cities and Summer Olympic Games venue cities. Cities in China diﬀer in hierarchical signiﬁcance. In particular, our regression sample includes four mu- nicipalities directly under central government control (i.e., Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin and Chongqin). Meanwhile, the 2008 Summer Olympic Games were held in China, which had signiﬁcant impacts on the economy and society. To examine whether our estimates are driven by these municipalities and the 2008 Summer Olympic Games venue cities, we exclude them and re-estimate the equation. Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 2. We again ﬁnd similar results, suggesting that our results are not driven by inﬂuential cities. Spatial spillovers. One concern for identiﬁcation is that non-TCZ cities bordering 25See Chetty et al. (2009) and La Ferrara et al.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT TCZ cities would also be aﬀected by the new evaluation system, as polluting ﬁrms could be easily moved from TCZ to non-TCZ cities that border each other. To rule out this possibility, we exclude non-TCZ cities bordering TCZ cities in the analysis. As shown in Table 4, column 3, the estimated coeﬃcients for SO2 emissions and GDP growth rate remain negative and statistically signiﬁcant. These results provide evidence that our results are not driven by bordering cities. An alternative measurement of pollution reduction. Note that SO2 emissions data were monitored and collected by the SEPA. The whole process followed a strict protocol and was subject to internal auditing, making it diﬃcult for local bureaucrats to manipulate the data. However, one may still be concerned that there might be some collusion between SEPA oﬃcials and local bureaucrats, and the SO2 emissions data were inaccurate. To address this concern, we use PM2.5 as an alternative measure of SO2 emissions. PM2.5 particles can be directly emitted or produced from emitted precursors. Pollutants such as SO2, nitrate and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can react in the atmosphere to produce PM2.5. Although changes in PM2.5 can be a complicated process, PM2.5 can be used as a good alternative measure for SO2 emissions (Hoden and Barnard, 2015). In our setting, we ﬁnd a correlation coeﬃcient of 0.22 between the logarithm of the SO2 emissions and the logarithm of PM2.5. The PM2.5 data were extracted from the grid data of Global Annual PM2.5 Grids from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Multi-angle Imaging Spectro Radiometer (MISR) Aerosol Optical Depth, which provides a continuous surface of concentrations of particulate matter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller.26 The grid data were derived by researchers in the U.S. from satellite data provided by NASA; thus, the source of the PM2.5 data is completely independent of the SO2 emissions levels reported by the SEPA. Estimation results of the policy eﬀect on PM2.5 particles are reported in Table 4, column 4. The estimated coeﬃcient is negative and statistically signiﬁcant. A decrease in PM2.5 as a result of the 2005 policy, in the absence of regulations for the other reactors, supports our hypothesis that the policy eﬀectively reduced SO2 emissions. Inclusion of additional time-varying city characteristics. The inclusion of Zc ∗ f(t) in Table 3, column 2 shows a signiﬁcant drop in the estimated magnitude (i.e., about 36%). As Zc ∗ f(t) controls for the ﬂexible time trends in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities due to the diﬀerences in initial conditions, the drop in magnitude may imply that the time-varying characteristics of the TCZ and non-TCZ cities diﬀer. To address this concern, we further include several time-varying city characteristics such as log GDP per capita, share of manufacturing sectors, coal abundance and trade intensity. 26The raster grids have a grid cell resolution of 30 arc-minutes and cover the world from 70◦N to 60◦S latitude. 16', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT We ﬁrst replace the cubic time trends of the initial conditions with these time-varying controls in Appendix Table A.2, column 3. We continue to ﬁnd a negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimate, with the decrease in magnitude about 24%. These results conﬁrm that our selection of time-varying city characteristics capture important diﬀerential trends in outcomes between TCZ and non-TCZ cities. We then further add these time-varying controls to our baseline regression shown equation (1) (that is, along with the cubic time trends of the initial conditions). Estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 5. Our results remain robust to these additional controls, lending further support to our identiﬁcation. Matched DD estimation. As a further robustness check, we combine our DD estima- tion with a PSM strategy. Speciﬁcally, we match for each TCZ city, to a non-TCZ city based on seven key criteria that the central government used to determine TCZ cities. These variables include roughness, elevation, wind speed, precipitation, soil pH level, coldness and dirty sector employment.27 The estimation results are reported in Table 4, column 6. We continue to ﬁnd negative and statistically signiﬁcant estimates for the SO2 emissions and the GDP growth rate from this combined DD and PSM estimation framework, implying the robustness of our ﬁndings. 4.3. Non-targeted pollutants Our results show that the new evaluation system in 2005 introduced a substantial trade-oﬀ between SO2 emissions and GDP growth. One possible explanation for the observed policy eﬀect is that the new system made bureaucrats more concerned about the reduction in SO2 emissions (the policy-targeted pollutant) and shifted their eﬀorts away from economic development. It would then be interesting to investigate when the eﬀorts were redistributed into environmental protection in general, or were they placed on the policy-targeted pollutant only. To this end, we examine the top pollutants outlined by the China Pollution Source Census 2007. Speciﬁcally, according to the Census, the four major air pollutants in China are SO2, soot, NOx and dust. As no reliable national data are available for the latter two, we include the analysis of the 2005 policy eﬀect on soot. We further estimate the policy eﬀect on other two other non-target pollutants: CO2 and waster water. If the policy works by incentivizing bureaucrats to target at SO2 emissions only, then should we not expect to see any policy eﬀect on these non-targeted pollutants. Speciﬁcally, data for waste water discharge were collected from the annual statistical yearbooks of the Chinese provinces, supplemented by the Chinese City Statistical Year- books 2004-2014 and Chinese Environmental Yearbooks 2002-2014. Data on soot were 27See footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors. 17', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Data on CO2 emissions were col- lected from the Global Change Simulation Data Center at National Science & Technology Infrastructure of China. CO2 data were available only for years 2003-2008, which we used for our analysis. We match the CO2 data with the city boundaries map and extract the corresponding CO2 concentration. Estimation results are reported in Table 5. None of the three estimated coeﬃcients are statistically signiﬁcant. We further test whether the regression coeﬃcients reported in Table 5 are equal to those reported in column 3, Table 3. Test statistics are reported in Panel B, Table 5. We cannot reject the null hypothesis that the policy impacts on Log(Soot) are equal to those on Log(SO2). However, our results do suggest that the policy impacts on Log(CO2) and Log(wastewater) are diﬀerent from those on Log(SO2), as shown in columns 2 and 3 in Panel B, Table 5. Note that the polluting sources for SO2 are very diﬀerent from CO2 and wastewater but similar to soot, particularly for industrial SO2 and soot emissions. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that local bureaucrats, who are motivated by their career concerns, care only about policy-targeted pollution reductions instead of the overall environmental improvement. [Insert Table 5 here] 5. Mechanisms Our analysis shows that the 2005 policy (which included the SO2 emissions reduction in the bureaucrat promotion consideration) caused a signiﬁcant fall in the SO2 emissions and in the GDP growth rate. In this section, we explore mechanisms through which this policy was at work to shed light on the substitution of eﬀorts between pollution reduction and economic development. 5.1. Policy measures The 2005 policy included a series of measures to meet the emissions reduction tar- gets in the TCZ cities, such as the closure of high SO2 concentration coal mines, the increasing control of SO2 emissions from thermal power plants and industrial boilers, and the introduction of more energy-saving and low pollution technologies (Cao et al., 2009). Local government oﬃcials in China have administrative powers over state-owned industrial sectors. Per the second China National Economic Census of 2008, over 51.1% of power plants are owned by the state. These power plants comprise more than 77.8% of workers in the entire power plant sector and 81.4% of the sector’s total capital. For state-owned power plants, city mayors and secretaries determine whether or not to op- erate these plants as well as plant locations and operating capacity. In the remainder of this section, we will analyse ﬁve policy measures that are related to the operations of power plants. If it is shown that these measures were more eﬀectively enforced by local 18', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

One measure is to install desulfurization facilities in the thermal power plants to contain their emissions, which are one of the major sources of SO2 emissions. To this end, we collect desulfu- rization data for thermal power plants from the Compilation of Statistical Materials of Electric Power Industry 2001-2010. This dataset covers all thermal power plants with an installed capacity of 6,000 KW and above, and accounts for more than 99% of all fossil-fuel power electricity generation capacity in China.29 There are a total of 2210 power plants in our sample, averaged at 7.7 plants per city.30 Firm-level estimation re- sults are reported in Table 6, column 1. We ﬁnd a positive and statistically signiﬁcant coeﬃcient, indicating that after the new evaluation system in 2005, thermal power plants increased their desulfurization rates (measured as the rate of desulfurization facilities over total facilities). These results suggest that this measure for reducing SO2 emissions was implemented by local bureaucrats. [Insert Table 6 here] Exit and entry of thermal power plants. To reduce SO2 emissions, the 2005 policy also required TCZ cities to shut down small thermal power plants and contain the new establishment of thermal power plants. To check the enforcement of these measures, we construct the entry and exit of thermal power plants at the city level using the same plant-level data mentioned above. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, columns 2 and 3. Our estimates show that the 2005 policy caused more exits and fewer entries of thermal power plants, conﬁrming that the measures were in eﬀect. Given that thermal power plants were the major source of electricity generation in China, these data may imply a slowdown in the economic development. Controlling the growth of dirty sectors.31 Another important measure is to contain 28The plant-level data also help address the issue of gaming brought up in previous literature. Under the target-based system, ﬁrms or individuals would be incentivized to manipulate data and reporting to achieve the pre-set goal (Bevan and Hood, 2006; Chen et al., 2012; Gao, 2015). Plant-level data serve as a crosscheck for city-level SO2 emission levels and provide further support for our main results. 29The plant level data can allow us to investigate the heterogeneity of responses across ﬁrms. In particular, one potential future work is to collect data on connections between local oﬃcials and ﬁrms, and examine how the burdens of regulation diﬀer across connected and disconnected ﬁrms. We thank a reviewer for this suggestion. 30The authors identify locations for all thermal power plants mentioned in the Compilation by manually searching for their physical addresses. We then match the plant-level desulfurization progress data released by the Ministry of Environment Protection to our sample. Plant entry and exit data were obtained from the list released annually by the National Development and Reform Commission. 31See footnote 5 for the deﬁnition of dirty sectors. 19', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

To check the implementation of this measure, we collect data from the Annual Surveys of Manufacturing Firms from 2000 to 2008, which are the most comprehensive ﬁrm data in China (including all state-owned enterprises, and non-state- owned enterprise with annual sales above about US$ 74,000). Speciﬁcally, we compare the ﬁrm entry and exit pattern in the dirty sectors between TCZ and non-TCZ cities during this sample period. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, columns 4 and 5. We ﬁnd a negative but not statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient of ﬁrm entry, and a positive and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient of ﬁrm exit. These results imply that after the 2005 policy, there were more ﬁrm exits in the dirty sectors in the TCZ cities compared with the non-TCZ ones, though the two groups of cities had very similar ﬁrm entry patterns in the dirty sectors. Improving the SO2 removal rate. One policy measure requested the improvement of the SO2 removal rate, especially in the dirty sectors. SO2 removal rates are the percentage of total amount of SO2 emissions reduced by various desulfurization technologies. To examine this measure, we calculate the city-level SO2 removal rate as the ratio of the total amount of city SO2 removals over the sum of city SO2 removed and city SO2 emissions. Data were collected from the China City Statistical Yearbooks 2004-2016. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, column 6. We ﬁnd a positive and statistically signiﬁcant estimated coeﬃcient, suggesting the improving SO2 removal rate in the TCZ cities after the 2005 policy. Restructuring of the energy composition. To reduce SO2 emissions, the 2005 policy also suggested an improvement in the energy structure, that is, a shift toward clean energies (such as hydropower, wind power, and nuclear power). To examine the policy eﬀect on the energy structure, we construct a city-level share of clean energies, that is, the share of electricity-generating capacity from hydropower, wind power, and nuclear power over the total capacity. Data for the share of clean energy were collected from the Compilation of Statistical Materials of Electric Power Industry 2001-2010. Estimation results are reported in Table 6, column 7. The estimated coeﬃcient is small and not statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting no shift toward clean energies after the 2005 policy. In sum, our analyses show that most of the measures for reducing SO2 emissions in the 2005 policy were enforced by local bureaucrats, which explains the signiﬁcant drop in SO2 emissions in TCZ cities after 2005 compared with non-TCZ cities. Meanwhile, some of these measures (such as the closure and establishment restriction of thermal power plants, controlling of growth in dirty sectors, etc.) had negative implications for economic development. 20', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

Revealed preference by local bureaucrats As the second mechanism analysis, we investigate how local bureaucrats revealed their eﬀorts for pollution reduction and economic growth. To this end, we conduct a thorough content analysis of each city government’s Annual Work of the Government Report from 2001 to 2015. The report is usually presented by the city mayor at the city- level National People’s Congress early in the year. The report sets the goals and objectives for city governments’ work for the upcoming year and is meant to be supervised by local residents. Each report outlines the target GDP growth rate for the year, as well as other policy objectives for the city government. As the reports are not available in any existing database or statistical yearbooks, we collected information by manually searching 4288 reports via the China Statistical Yearbooks at city level, city governments’ websites and local newspapers. For pollution reduction, we search for the keywords “environmental protection” (huan bao or huanjing baohu in Chinese) and “emissions reduction” (jian pai in Chinese), and calculate the ratio of the number of these mentions to be the total number of words in the report. We then examine whether the government reports in TCZ cities had more coverage of environmental protection than in non-TCZ cities after 2005. Regression results are reported in Table 7, column 1. We ﬁnd that TCZc ∗ Post05t is positive and statistically signiﬁcant, suggesting that TCZ city governments became more concerned about environmental protection after 2005 than non-TCZ city governments. [Insert Table 7 here] In the report, the governments also report their target GDP growth rate in the coming year, which allows us to capture each city government’s emphasis on economic growth. To this end, we estimate our baseline speciﬁcation using the target GDP growth rate as the outcome. Estimation results are reported in Table 7, column 2. We ﬁnd that after 2005, TCZ cities had lower target GDP growth rates than non-TCZ ones. Combined, these results suggest that local bureaucrats in TCZ cities were willing to trade oﬀ GDP growth to achieve the more stringent emissions reductions goal. 5.3. Signaling eﬀect While we focus on the career concerns explanation of our ﬁndings, another poten- tial channel for the policy to operate is to send stronger information signals to local bureaucrats about the preferences of the central government and the Communist Party. Speciﬁcally, the veto power of emissions quota in the 2005 policy could strongly suggest the determination of the central government to combat the increasing SO2 emissions. Thus, our ﬁndings of SO2 reductions after the 2005 policy could be an improvement in the information received by local bureaucrats, instead of the motivation of career con- cerns. 21', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT To examine whether our ﬁndings reﬂect the signaling argument, we show that there is a clustering of cities at the target SO2 reduction level. To this end, we use our manually collected city SO2 emissions quota by the end of the 11th Five-Year Plan (i.e., 2010), which allows us to construct the diﬀerence between the realized and target SO2 reductions for 158 out of the 286 cities in our sample.32 We plot the kernel density distributions of the diﬀerences for TCZ and non-TCZ cities in Fig. 4. We ﬁnd a clear clustering at the point 0, suggesting that local bureaucrats managed to just complete the pollution reduction requirement. Meanwhile, for TCZ cities, there is a much sharper concentration of SO2 reductions just at the target level. These results further suggest the relevance of the career concerns argument for our ﬁndings. [Insert Figure 4 here] 6. Welfare analyses In this section, we present a welfare analysis of the 2005 policy. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst focus on the trade-oﬀs between SO2 emissions reductions and GDP growth, and then compute the health damage and value of statistical lives saved due to the policy. 6.1. Trade-oﬀs between SO2 emissions reductions and GDP growth As shown in Table 3, columns 3 and 4, the 2005 policy led to an average reduction in SO2 emissions by 5564 tonnes at the city level, and a slowdown in the GDP growth rate by 0.846 percentage point. The average city-level GDP in our sample period between 2001 and 2015 is 126.9 × 109 in Chinese Yuan (CNY).33 Due to the spatial diﬀerence in prices, we follow Brandt and Holz (2006) and adjust all GDP values using a provincial price deﬂator with the price of Beijing in 1999 as the baseline. Therefore, a 0.846 percentage point reduction in GDP growth means a loss of 1.07 billion CNY in output (126.9×109 × 0.846% = 1.07 × 109). In other words, one tonne of reduction in industrial SO2 emissions would cost 192,950 CNY (1.07 × 109/5564 = 192, 950). Our estimate shows that local bureaucrats made a decision to forgo a large GDP in exchange for a fast and sizable reduction in SO2 emissions. Welfare beneﬁts of emissions reductions, such as mortality and health consequences, are usually computed based on pollutant concentration (µg/m3) in the literature. To be consistent with existing literature, we also compute the marginal cost per µg/m3 reduction in SO2 concentration. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst convert SO2 emissions reductions 32Note that the sample size we use in this analysis is smaller than that in Table 2. This is because in constructing Table 1, we need to know only whether a city has achieved its targeted reduction or not. For the analysis presented here, we need to know the target and actual reductions in numbers. 33Authors’ own calculation using data from all 286 cities in our sample.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT from weights to reductions in the concentration in the air. Appendix A outlines the detailed method we use to do the conversion. Using the method, a reduction of 5564 tonnes in SO2 emissions weight is equivalent to a reduction of 4.1 µg/m3 in SO2 air concentration at city level. Therefore, based on our estimates in Table 3, every 1 µg/m3 reduction in SO2 concentration would cost 261 million CNY (1.07 × 109/(4.1µg/m3) = 261 × 106). In the next section, we use the converted reduction in SO2 air concentration to com- pute value of statistical lives saved by the policy. 6.2. Health damage and value of statistical lives As an alternative method for welfare analysis, we deviate from the SO2-GDP trade-oﬀ, and calculate health damage of pollution to evaluate our estimated eﬀect of the policy. According to World Bank (1997), there is no direct mortality risk associated with SO2 exposure. The report also suggests that the disease incidences associated with per million per µg/m3 increase in SO2 concentration for chest discomfort and respiratory symptoms (child) are 10,000 cases and 5 cases per million people, respectively. Using the valuation given in Ho and Jorgenson (2003), the cost per case is 9.8 in 1997 CNY.34 According to the government documentation, TCZ cities cover about 39% of population in China.35 Assume that China has a population of 1.4 billion, and the 2005 policy reduced the SO2 air concentration by 4.1 µg/m3, the estimated policy eﬀect on reduction in disease incidences for TCZ cities therefore has a monetary value of 219.5 million (1997 CNY) (4.1× 39% × 1400× (10,000× 9.8 +5× 9.8) = 219.5 million). Note that the cost of SO2 reduction (in terms of GDP) presented in the previous section is at the city level, while the social beneﬁt of disease incidences reduction is at the national level. To make the numbers comparable, we need to multiply the cost of SO2 reduction at city level by the number of TCZ cities in our sample (i.e. 1.07 × 162 =173 billion). While there is no direct mortality risk of SO2 as suggested by the World Bank report, there would be secondary mortality risks if SO2 is converted to PM2.5. Our analysis indicates that the 2005 policy reduced PM2.5 concentration by 1.5% (Table 4, Column 4). Based on Chen et al. (2017), the national average mortality risk associated with every 10 µg/m3 reduction in PM2.5 is about 17.55 thousand lives. The average PM2.5 level in our sample city is 31.66 µg/m3.36 Therefore, a 1.5% reduction in PM2.5 concentration would lead to 833 (31.66 × 1.5% × 17550/10 = 833) lives saved. Based on World Bank’s valuation, the estimated value of a statistical life is about 585,000 in 1997 CNY.37 Thus, 34In later updates made by Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the authors adjust the valuation per case to be 6.2 (low scenario) and 10 (high scenario), both in 1997 CNY. 35The relevant Chinese document for the TCZ policy is available at the following government website: http://www.mep.gov.cn/gkml/zj/wj/200910/t20091022_172231.htm 36See Table 2. 37The estimated value of statistical life in the literature ranges from 230,000 - 1.2 million in 1997 CNY. 23', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT the total value of statistical lives saved due to the 2005 policy is about 487.3 million in 1997 CNY (833 × 585,000 = 487.3 ×106). In summary, our welfare analysis suggests that the cost of the program far exceeds its beneﬁt. As the program is able to achieve the targeted emissions cut in a very short period of time, our calculation suggests that the Chinese government is willing to pay a premium for immediate and sizable pollution reductions. 7. Conclusion In this paper, we examine the eﬀect of a target-based performance evaluation system on SO2 emissions reductions. We ﬁnd that when SO2 emissions quotas were built into the evaluation system for local bureaucrats, SO2 emissions were signiﬁcantly reduced. In the meantime, real GDP growth rates also decreased signiﬁcantly. Our analysis suggests that the new evaluation system induced local bureaucrats to exert more eﬀort on environ- mental issues related to SO2 emissions. We ﬁnd no spillover eﬀects of the policy on other non-targeted pollutants such as CO2 or wastewater. Using a comprehensive dataset that we constructed, we observe that after the new administrative system was in place, local bureaucrats are more likely to implement policies that speciﬁcally targeted SO2 emissions reduction, such as shutting down power plants and installing desulfurization technologies. Implementation of these policies indicates that local bureaucrats are exerting more eﬀort on achieving the target set for decreasing emissions by the central government. Our ﬁnding adds to the empirical debate on the eﬀectiveness of target-based perfor- mance evaluation systems for public sector workers, particularly for management-level bureaucrats. As the earlier literature has highlighted, the addition of a concrete perfor- mance target into an evaluation system might aﬀect the overall comprehensive output as bureaucrats will divert their attention to the output that is more heavily weighted by their supervisors. Our analysis shows a clear pattern that the local bureaucrats made a conscious trade-oﬀ between growth and SO2 emissions when emissions targets are brought into the picture. Our results indicate that setting a concrete target-based performance evaluation sys- tem for environmental policies can be eﬀective in ensuring that bureaucrats work to curb pollution and promote environmental protection. The eﬀect is immediate, and the impact is signiﬁcant. Developing countries facing similar pressing environmental issues might want to consider the implementation of such a policy.

       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Appendix A We use a method proposed by Ho and Jorgenson (2003) to convert reductions in emissions in weight to reductions in the SO2 ambient air concentration. Speciﬁcally, total SO2 emissions at height c can be expressed as Ec = Σj∈cEj (3) where c = low, medium and high. High-emissions industries include all types of electricity power sectors. Medium-emissions industries include coal mining, natural gas and metal ming sectors etc. Low-emissions industries include agriculture and all tertiary sectors. 38 To convert the total emissions Ec into the air concentration, we follow the linear reduced form suggested by Ho and Jorgenson (2002) and Garbaccio et al. (2000) 39 : C = γlowElow + γmediumEmedium + γhighEhigh where γlow, γmedium and γhigh are conversion coeﬃcient computed by the authors based on Lvovsky and Hughes (1997). For urban SO2 emissions, γlow = 0.03364, γmedium = 0.00607 and γhigh = 0.00096. These coeﬃcients are computed for 11 Chinese cities us- ing a emission-concentration dispersion model. Ho and Jorgenson (2003) reweigh these coeﬃcients to arrive at the conversion coeﬃcient γ for all urban China. We use a sim- ilar strategy in Ho and Jorgenson (2003) and reweigh their coeﬃcients proportionately so that it matches the average SO2 concentration level in our sample period. We then compute the reduction of the SO2 concentration as a result of the 2005 policy change. Our method can be outlined in the following steps: Step 1: Recalibrate the conversion coeﬃcients γlow, γmedium and γhigh. The origi- nal conversion coeﬃcients computed by Lvovsky and Hughes (1997) are γlow = 0.03364, γmedium = 0.00607 and γhigh = 0.00096, but the coeﬃcients capture only the 11 Chinese cities in their sample. In order to compute a national conversion coeﬃcient, we need to calibrate these numbers so that they match the national average SO2 concentration in our sample period. There are no SO2 air concentration values for cities in our dataset; there- fore we resort to other resources. The Ambient Air Quality Standard in China classiﬁes cities with average SO2 concentration below 60 µg/m3 as healthy and below 10 µg/m3 as good. According to the annual report published by the Ministry of Environmental Protection in China, in our sample period more than 80% of cities has an average SO2 38Please see Ho and Jorgenson (2003) for a complete list of industry emissions height classiﬁcations. 39In Ho and Jorgenson (2007), the authors discuss the diﬀerence between the emissions height method and a method based on intake fractions. We are not able to implement the intake fractions method as we do not know the exact breakdown of the emissions industries (we know only the broad categories as indicated in Table 1). Thus, for our purpose, the method presented in this section is the most feasible. 25', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='MANUSCRIPT ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT concentrations between 10 µg/m3 and 60 µg/m3.40 When the initial TCZ policy was designed in 1998, all cities with annual SO2 concentrations higher than 60 µg/m3 were classiﬁed as TCZ cities. Therefore, we would calibrate the coeﬃcients against 60 µg/m3 for our analysis. The average city- level annual industrial emissions in our control sam- ple is 38110 tonnes. According to the China Pollution Source Census 2007, industrial emissions usually consist of 91.4% of the total emissions, while the remaining 8.6% is non- industrial emissions. Therefore, we assume the average total emissions are 38110/0.914 = 41696 tonnes (38110 industrial emissions and 3586 non-industrial emissions). Following Ho and Jorgenson (2003), we assume the coeﬃcients are being re-scaled proportionately. Let ϕ be the scaling factor. Then the following conditions have to be satisﬁed: 60µg/m3 = 0.03364ϕElow + 0.00607ϕEmedium + 0.00096ϕEhigh Elow + Emedium + Ehigh = 41696 (4) To determine emissions at diﬀerent heights, i.e., Elow, Emedium and Ehigh, we ﬁrst match the emitting industries in Table 1 to the emission height class data in Ho and Jorgenson (2003). Among the industrial sectors mentioned in Table 1, the production and supply of electricity power and heat is considered high while everything else is in the medium cate- gory. Note that Table 1 covers only 88.5% of all industrial SO2 emissions. For simplicity, we assume the missing 12.5% industrial emissions are proportionately distributed between the high and medium categories. In other words, out of the total 38110 tonnes industrial emissions, 56.95% (50.4%/88.5%) would be in the high emissions category, and the rest (43.05%) would be in the medium category. Therefore, Ehigh = 38110 × 56.95% = 21704 tonne and Emedium = 38110 × 43.05% = 16406 tonnes. Non-industrial emissions come from either the agriculture sector or households; both are classiﬁed as the low emissions category. Therefore, Elow = 3586 tonnes. Substitute the emissions number Elow,Emedium and Ehigh back in equation 4, and we get ϕ = 0.25. After calibration, the conversion coeﬃcients, therefore, are γlow = 0.00841, γmedium = 0.00152 and γhigh = 0.00024. Step 2: In this step, we compute the reduction in the SO2 concentration. We have computed that the policy reduces total industrial emissions by 5564 tonnes. We assume the reductions are distributed proportionately across sectors in Table 1 and the policy has no impact on non-industrial sectors. Thus, 56.95% of the emissions reductions happens in the high emissions category while 43.05% happens in the low emissions category. This means after reduction Ehigh = 21704 − 5, 564 × 56.95% = 18535 tonnes and Emedium = 16406−5564×43.05% = 14011 tonnes. Therefore, after reduction, the SO2 concentration 40For relevant government documents, please see the Ministry of Environmental Protection’s website at http://www.mep.gov.cn/ 26', metadata={'author': 'Yvonne Jie Chen and Pei Li and Yi Lu', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'Career concerns and multitasking local bureaucrats: Evidence of a target-based performance evaluation system in China', 'journal': 'Journal of Development Economics'}),\n",

A relative standard for corruption consequently arises since non-implementation of laws may be mandate-serving or may be corrupt; and determining which requires extra information on why non-implementation occurred. The theory is supported by evidence from original survey and case research on the implementation of the village elections law.

INTRODUCTION Corruption in China is widely seen as an intractable prob- lem despite the fact that the ruling Communist Party has pub- licly prioritized ﬁghting corruption and issued ambitious reforms to do so. While studies of corruption in China have illuminated much about the patterns, causes, and conse- quences of corruption, there remains the puzzle of why the re- gime has so much diﬃculty ﬁghting corruption despite the use of its powerful oversight and disciplinary systems. Prominent existing explanations for the regime’s failure focus on lack of central commitment, resistance from local oﬃcials, and too- limited strategies. Beyond these factors, in this paper I propose an underappreciated institutional explanation: that China has a governing system in which it is inherently diﬃcult to even identify corruption. This explanation may seem counterintuitive, given the repu- tation of the Chinese Communist Party for invasive monitor- ing, but here I show why it may be an important missing part of the equation. My reasoning is not premised on the notion that the party’s information on its oﬃcials is especially poor, but rather on the idea that the information the party requires to identify what it would count as “corruption” is unusually great and hard to obtain. This additional information burden arises, I argue, as a consequence of China’s particular govern- ing system, which I call a “rule of mandates” system, as op- posed to a more familiar rule of law system. Under a “rule of mandates,” the regime does not hold its oﬃcials accountable to ﬁxed standards but rather to relative standards. Instead of directing oﬃcials to implement the re- gime’s laws and policies unconditionally, the party directs them to implement a subset of “mandates” according to their relative prioritization. As I invoke the term here, mandates do not simply represent an alternate set of laws parallel to the public body of laws. In contrast to a body of laws, mandates are directives that are hierarchically ranked against each other. Lower oﬃcials are expected to give more weight to the higher priority mandates, and they are authorized to adjust the imple- mentation of laws and lower priority mandates to aim at the desired ends. In this system, the implementation of laws is thus conditional on their compatibility with higher priority mandates. Under both a rule of mandates and a rule of law, we can think of corruption as occurring when oﬃcials deviate from the duties of public oﬃce for personal gain. Yet, identifying such a deviation from the duties of public oﬃce is much more straightforward under a rule of law system than under a rule of mandates system. When laws govern, the failure to imple- ment laws and policies—a readily observable measure—is an indicator of a potentially serious problem, likely corruption. Yet when mandates govern, oﬃcials’ failures to implement policies and laws are not red ﬂags for corruption, so long as the deviations do not involve policies designated with the high- est priority. The oﬃcials might have exercised their discretion to decide that a lower priority mandate, like environmental protection programs and the relevant laws, should not be lo- cally implemented lest it hinder a higher priority mandate, like economic growth. Thus, in a rule of mandates system, the standard for corruption is a relative one. To have reasonable suspicion that oﬃcials are corrupt, leaders also need to evalu- ate why a law or policy was not implemented (unless the pol- icies are designated as highest priority), not just see that it was not implemented. The information needed to make such an evaluation is detailed, costly to collect, diﬃcult to analyze, and often unavailable. In Part I of this paper, I develop the theoretical argument above and relate it to diﬀerent ways of deﬁning corruption and the problem of detecting corruption. In Parts II, III, and IV of this paper, I ground the theory in survey and case evidence consistent with its arguments. While the data are not adequate to establish where corruption exists, it does establish that, under a rule of mandates, lower oﬃcials can easily veil corruption behind the rhetoric of meeting man- dates. Original evidence pertaining to the implementation of China’s village elections law is used to show that the rule of * I am very grateful to numerous colleagues for their invaluable input, most especially Pierre Landry, Susan Rose-Ackerman, Ian Shapiro, Shiru Wang, and Lynn White.

       " Document(page_content='mandates system makes corruption particularly diﬃcult to de- tect in China. First, I show that it is diﬃcult for higher oﬃcials to obtain accurate information on the base line situation, the extent to which the election law was implemented in locales. Reports from local oﬃcials often seem unreliable when com- pared to reports from surveyed villagers. Second, I show that it is even more diﬃcult to interpret why the elections law was poorly implemented, as local oﬃcials generally claim that their interference with village elections was for the purpose of promoting one of the highest priority mandates, namely political “stability,” even as the evidence is that their interference does not do so. Case study evidence shows how local oﬃcials may actually sometimes be hiding be- hind the mandates to shelter their own corruption. In Part V, I conclude with a discussion of three implications. First, I underscore how the relationship between decentraliza- tion and corruption depends on broader governing institu- tions. Second, I discuss the possibility that a rule of mandates might be used in developmental ways and yet still destabilize over the long term. Third, I discuss why common approaches to anticorruption that are compatible with a rule of law are in tension with a rule of mandates. 2. THE RULE OF MANDATES AND THE CHALLENGES OF DETECTING CORRUPTION China is relatively decentralized ﬁscally, yet centralized politically, in large part through a system of targets and incen- tives that control local cadres and inﬂuence which policies and laws they implement. Collectively, we can think of the targets and incentives as authoritarian mandates from above. Man- dates diﬀer from laws principally in that they are attached to hierarchical rankings such that higher priority mandates take precedence over lower priority ones. In practice in China, mandates are also typically hidden from the public, regard fewer issues in less detail, and call for adherence to particular outcomes rather than particular processes. These additional features also distinguish typical mandates from typical laws, but should not be mistaken for their deﬁning feature. The key fact that mandates are ranked against each other means that not all policies need to be, or should be, pursued locally, depending on how they interact with each other and local con- ditions. Under a rule of mandates, lower oﬃcials are given signiﬁ- cant discretion; they are authorized to adjust the implementa- tion of laws and lower priority mandates as they aim at the desired outcomes. This means that the standards for corrup- tion are eﬀectively relative rather than absolute, as explained below. This system is useful for the regime because it ensures that high priority targets will be locally implemented even when central oﬃcials have little knowledge of the local imple- mentation challenges. Yet, I argue, one major drawback of the rule of mandates paradigm for China is that it makes it espe- cially diﬃcult to reliably detect potentially corrupt behavior. Because variations in the local implementation of central pol- itics are supposed to occur under a rule of mandates, higher oﬃcials must know why variations occur in order to judge if the variations are the result of good-faith eﬀorts to meet man- dates or corruption. In this system, local corruption can easily mask itself as deference to the centralized mandates. (a) The rule of mandates model in China China’s system for maintaining political control of lower level oﬃcials relies on well-deﬁned incentives and sanctions designed to uphold party directives (Landry, 2008). Broad party directives, which are separate from if sometimes consis- tent with the public law, are issued at the highest level. Consis- tently among the highest national priorities are economic development, social stability, and the birth control policy, which are measured by ﬁgures such as income per capita, inci- dences of collective protests, and the population growth rate. At lower levels, more speciﬁcs are developed about the exact targets, priorities, reporting requirements, rewards for success, and penalties for failure; these thus vary from area to area. Lo- cal leaders now actually sign contracts that acknowledge the targets and terms surrounding them. The most serious targets are those with veto power (yipiao foujue), followed by hard targets (ying zhibiao), and soft targets (yiban zhibiao) (Hei- mer, 2006). Some laws and issues are such low priority that there are no targets corresponding to them. Most important of all for cadres are the veto-level targets. If a township fails to meet targets with veto power by the end-of- the-year evaluation, the failure would eliminate all credit to township leaders for other successes achieved that year (Edin, 2003). Poor performance evaluations may not only result in the loss of an annual bonus or prospects for promotion of individual oﬃcials, but may even result in large ﬁnes and pen- alties for all their colleagues. In other words, the “cadre responsibility system” makes extensive use of strict liability, collective liability, and vicarious liability (Minzner, 2009). Col- lective responsibility implies that oﬃcials have an institution- alized individual incentive to aid their colleagues—or equally, to overlook or assist false reporting by their col- leagues. Mandates are pre-set, often by formula, and cover only a limited number of items that are hierarchically ranked against each other. For items that are high priority, accountability is tightly tied to apparent outcomes; for items that are low prior- ity or not explicitly mentioned, there may be limited or no accountability at all. For instance, in one Shanghai county studied by Susan Whiting, growth in township- and village- run industries was worth up to 33 points, and “party building” activities like educating party members were worth 21 points—and provision of public education was worth only nine points (out of a possible total of 200 points). The speciﬁc formula used to evaluate performance in these areas was fur- ther speciﬁed, and depended on quantitative data such as the “increase in industrial proﬁts” and “the completion rate for compulsory education” (Whiting, 2004). With such criteria, at its best, the cadre responsibility system is set up to incentiv- ize a precise but narrow space of accountability. At its worst, it does not incentivize actual accountability but only apparent accountability, since the criteria for evaluation are often not directly visible to higher cadres so data may be easily fudged or made up by lower cadres. Variation in the local implementation of laws is thus an inherent outcome of the rule of mandates, even in the absence of corruption. To meet the mandates, cadres are supposed to adjust the implementation of lower priority laws and policies to better meet higher priority targets. Moreover, unless public grievances pertain to a target, public pressure may be safely ig- nored by cadres. Eﬀective public grievances are partly man- aged by secrecy; as explicit as the targets are to cadres, they remain mysterious to the public. Party directives and contracts are generally treated as conﬁdential internal documents, so that the public generally remains unaware of the speciﬁcs or even the existence of them. At the same time, targets do not necessarily correspond to public laws let alone local public preferences, nor are they subject to them. In fact, in indicating to cadres which laws and issues to prioritize, and which they 56 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='may safely ignore, the mandates drive deeply political choices about which the public is usually in the dark. (b) Relative standards for corruption Since local variation in the implementation of laws and pol- icies is an inherent goal of the rule of mandates, impermissible variations—those implying corruption—must be distinguished from permissible variations. Accordingly, common deﬁnitions of corruption take on a diﬀerent meaning in the context of a rule of mandates. Deﬁnitions of corruption that are under- stood to invoke an absolute standard elsewhere actually in- voke a relative standard under China’s rule of mandates. By a relative standard, I mean that activities that are oﬃcially viewed as corruption under certain circumstances are not viewed as corruption under other circumstances, since local oﬃcials are given discretion to adjust the implementation of laws to achieve higher political priorities. To illustrate this, consider one widely used deﬁnition of cor- ruption, as the “misuse” or “abuse of public oﬃce for private gain” (Manion, 2004; Rose-Ackerman, 1999; The World Bank, 1997). Under this deﬁnition, the law is commonly used as the absolute benchmark for corruption. As Svensson writes, “Misuse, of course, typically involves applying a legal stan- dard” (italics mine) (Svensson, 2005). By a legal standard, this deﬁnition of corruption encompasses practices that are against the law, such as bribery, extortion, embezzlement, or manipu- lating elections. However, in China, these practices may not always be against the mandates, because, ﬁrst, the mandates set diﬀerent standards than the law, and second, the standards they set are relative ones. On the ﬁrst point, mandates may set diﬀerent standards than the law or imply contradictory standards. For instance, even though the law states that village heads should be elected by villagers and that any eligible voter can be elected, one com- mon mandate states that village heads should be party mem- bers, implying that electoral choice might need to be curtailed. For another instance, even though embezzlement and extortion are against Chinese criminal law, mandates sometimes distinguish minor malfeasances as a separate, less signiﬁcant category. Oﬃcials are often given exemption from prosecution for cases involving limited monetary amounts, sometimes even if legal action has already been started (Man- ion, 2004). Instead, they might be modestly disciplined by the party. Although this approach might appear to represent a corrupt “rule of man” in which oﬃcials are modifying rules at whim, it is in fact rule-abiding if the relevant rules are man- dates rather than laws. Thus, when mandates are used as the standard for corruption, as they are by the Communist Party in China, the meaning of “abuse” or “misuse” of public oﬃce is often diﬀerent than when laws are used as the standard. The same technical deﬁnition of corruption—as the abuse of public oﬃce for private gain—takes on a diﬀerent, non-law-based meaning under regime standards. Second, under mandates, the standards for corruption are relative rather than absolute. Since the distinctive features of mandates is that they are hierarchically ranked, what consti- tutes “abuse” or “misuse” may additionally depend on circum- stances and motives. Recognizing that implementing the full slate of mandates is impossible for most local governments, the rule of mandates allows non-implementation of lower pri- ority mandates including laws. For instance, oﬃcials do not have to implement village elections, even though it is the na- tional law, in places where they might threaten the highest pri- ority mandate, social stability. However, oﬃcials are not supposed to cancel or undermine elections for the sake of personal gain, versus party objectives. The same logic may be applied to whether or not low priority laws like environ- mental protection, historical preservation, or government open information acts should be implemented when they potentially create a conﬂict with higher priority goals like eco- nomic development or social stability. This relative standard for corruption grows out of an insti- tutional diﬀerence, a mandate-based governing system versus a law-based governing system. Thus, it is distinctive from cul- tural explanations for shifts in the meaning of corruption, although both provide reasons why corruption and law imple- mentation might vary across units under a single governing structure. While cultural diﬀerences may also generate relative standards for corruption (Triesman, 2000), the degree of cor- ruption in China cannot be fully explained by the values of the Chinese public (Sandholtz & Taagepera, 2005). Indeed, from a cultural standpoint, the Chinese public may be increasingly in- clined toward an absolute legal standard for corruption. O’Brien and Li argue that public laws have set new expecta- tions for the public, such that they feel entitled to rights they never historically enjoyed (O’Brien & Li, 2006). This means there is a potential gap between what the public might count as corruption and what oﬃcials might count as such. The for- mer might be concerned with what we could call law-violating corruption (an absolute standard) whereas the latter are fo- cused on mandate-violating corruption (a relative standard). (c) Higher information requirement to detect corruption A consequence of the relative standards for corruption is a heightened information requirement to detect corruption. Since the system authorizes uneven implementation of non- priority laws and policies, oﬃcials must generally not only know that a law or policy was violated, but why it was vio- lated. As I explore below, non-implementation of the village elections law would be acceptable if in the service of a higher mandate like stability or development, but corrupt if designed to facilitate personal theft of village assets. For another exam- ple, if illegal taxes are levied, the action could be viewed as accountable if the funds were redirected to support a priority unfunded mandate, perhaps a capital outlay for an infrastruc- ture project. Even if the funds were redirected into the salaries of local oﬃcials, this still might accord with mandates, since local oﬃcials’ salaries are often unfunded or underfunded, plus more oﬃcials might have to be hired to ensure tax collec- tion (Lin, Tao, & Liu, 2003). But if the reason for the illegal taxes was so an individual oﬃcial could simply pocket the funds, the behavior would be more akin to extortion or cor- rupt rent-seeking. Thus, depending on circumstances, an iden- tical activity could be interpreted as mandate-abiding or as a form of corruption. Such activities could range from graft to rent-seeking to prebendalism (Lu¨, 2000), i.e., non-monetary corruption. This heightened information burden (that more information is needed) is in addition to any information detection prob- lems (that information is hard to obtain), so the corruption monitoring problem is magniﬁed under a rule of mandates. Standard methods of detecting corruption in a rule of law con- text, such as investigating deviations in implementation, not- ing illegal fees and transfers, and public oversight, do not provide the required information on why laws and policies may have been violated with reference to mandates. Consis- tent with this, in recent history, China’s approach to detecting corruption relies on party agencies that begin investigations in response to reports of party member misconduct, in contrast to the public security approach of beginning with a crime DECENTRALIZATION AND VEILED CORRUPTION UNDER CHINA’S “RULE OF MANDATES” 57', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",

The need for greater information and the diﬃculty of obtaining it mean that corruption in a rule of mandates environment is more eas- ily veiled. 3. THE RULE OF MANDATES AND VILLAGE ELECTIONS IN CHINA In this and the following two sections, I use empirical evidence to ground the theory that corruption in China is par- ticularly hard to detect because it can mask itself as mandate- driven variations in policy implementation. I choose to examine evidence surrounding the implementation of China’s national law requiring village elections, for three reasons. First, the na- tional law sets a universal standard for when village elections should be held. Since 1998, all administrative villages, which are the lowest administrative units in rural areas, should have competitive public elections that meet minimum procedural requirements set out in the Organic Law on Villager Elections. Second, the extent of implementation is widely observable by villagers, so it is possible to assess implementation without rely- ing on oﬃcial reports, through surveying villagers as I do here. Third, there are two main competing reasons for oﬃcials to fail to implement village elections: they might be corrupt, or they might be trying to meet party mandates that subordinate village elections to critical targets such as social stability. By exploring the gap between the legal standard for village elections and the reality of their implementation, and by examining the ambigu- ity over why this gap exists, I illuminate how China’s rule of mandates can veil corruption. Village elections are useful to the CCP overall, and local oﬃ- cials are expected to implement them unless they conﬂict with higher priorities. The establishment of village elections in China was the controversial solution to a crisis of party legit- imacy in the countryside that was believed to be driven by par- asitic local leaders (Wang, 1997). By eﬀectively delegating to the public certain duties normally performed by township and county authorities (to select, discipline, and monitor cer- tain village leaders), top authorities hoped to overcome the authoritarian system’s information problems, save the energy and political capital of higher oﬃcials for other tasks, and shed responsibility for disliked village leaders and contentious politics (Alpermann, 2003; He & Lang, 2002; O’Brien & Li, 2000). In essence, they hoped to enlist villagers as occasional agents of the higher government in disciplining its everyday lo- cal agents, the village oﬃcials. For the elections to achieve this objective, they would need to be at least semi-competitive— not just for show. In line with this, an increasing body of evi- dence is showing that village elections are able to challenge vil- lage establishments and create better governing at the village level. At that lowest level, elections seem to bring about more trustworthy leaders, more political responsiveness, fairer land allocations, and increases in public goods (Birney, 2007; Brandt & Turner, 2003; Luo, Zhang, Huang, & Rozelle, 2007; Martinez-Bravo, Miquel, Qian, & Yao, 2011; O’Brien & Han, 2009). To the extent that elections are eﬀective in creating weak accountability to the public, they serve both the public and re- gime interests in political stability. Consistent with this role of village elections, central authorities have established minimal incentives for lower oﬃcials to implement village elections, at least to some degree. For instance, two of the variables that may ﬁgure into the evaluation of township and county govern- ments are the percentage of turnout in the village elections and the percentage of “failed elections” (elections not held to completion). The former has resulted in heavy mobilization of voters. While many voters may be reluctant or uninterested, especially when the elections are not particularly competitive, the relatively high turnout rates and public awareness of vot- ing is certainly partially attributable to the turnout targets. Failed elections may occur when the township decides to can- cel an election, when no one candidate gets a majority in the ﬁrst round and the township does not bother to hold a second round, when voter turnout is below 50%, or when serious problems occur. At the same time, the regime appears wary that village elec- tions may create accountability that is much stronger than it would like and ultimately destabilizing for Communist Party rule. After all, if the elections are not somewhat controlled, wouldn’t villagers be able to use the elections to instead de- mand that village oﬃcials act as their own agents in interfacing with higher levels of government? This possibility that elec- tions would inspire elected oﬃcials to try place pressure on higher oﬃcials, working together with villagers or collectively across villages, is not just hypothetical. In one dramatic exam- ple in Shandong province, 57 elected village heads in the Qixia area resigned en masse to make a statement, following re- peated and unsuccessful petitions to higher levels to discipline local party oﬃcials for the embezzlement of public funds, political violence, and other illegal activities (Beech, 2001; Eckholm, 2002). The mass resignation can be taken as both evidence of their own abilities to coordinate and the unwilling- ness of the party at any level to address their grievances. The idea that village elections would facilitate signiﬁcant political pressure beyond the village level is contrary to the purpose for which the regime created them. Elsewhere, I have argued that China’s system of internal authoritarian rule, the rule of mandates system described above, places a dynamic check on the possibility of unintended consequences of village elec- tions beyond the village level. Therefore, instances such as the Qixia one are not as common as they would otherwise be. This is because township or other mid-level oﬃcials can adjust the implementation of the village election law in their area, should they expect that the outcomes would hinder their top priority objectives. Thus, the optimal situation for the regime is that the village elections law be implemented to the degree it helps create sta- bility (by generating weak accountability of poorly-monitored village oﬃcials to the public), and no more than that (in order to evade the destabilizing eﬀects of strong accountability). In short, the optimal situation is to strike a balance. China’s rule of mandates system allows this balance to be achieved with a fair amount of precision, as it incentivizes local oﬃcials to ad- just village election implementation in order to meet centrally- mandated targets. The regime eﬀectively delegates to township-level oﬃcials the responsibility for striking a balance between the stabilizing and destabilizing eﬀects of village elections. It does so through the high prioritization of the “social stability” mandate, which in China, refers to a directive to maintain political stability. This central directive to avoid political tensions with the pub- lic translates, at lower levels, into speciﬁc targets to prevent collective public political activities. Typical stability targets mandate a low threshold for the manifestation of collective protests, collective complaints, and petitions to higher levels. These targets seem to be generally set as veto-level (the high- est) targets. The social stability veto targets may sometimes help and sometimes hinder the implementation of the elections law, depending on local circumstances and the discretionary judgment of local oﬃcials. Mid-level oﬃcials realize that good 58 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='elections could result in better leaders and reduce tensions with the public, whereas a highly controlled or missing election might spur protests and complaints. But, especially when there is a contentious issue like a land dispute with the higher gov- ernment, authorities might also fear that the election of an outsider would provide stronger leadership and organization to discontented villagers. Or, even if an elected outsider did not threaten the stability target, he might use his position with- in the system to threaten other priority targets like economic development plans. The requirements of the elections law have less relevance to implementation than calculations about the degree of implementation that is most likely to meet the social stability target and minimally threaten other targets. As one county oﬃcial in charge of overseeing village elections ex- plained to me, an oﬃcial like him would never gain much from implementing elections well according to law, but his evalua- tion would take a severe hit if there were even a single protest or piece of negative media coverage that could be related to an election. At the same time that township leaders are supposed to ad- just the implementation of the village election laws to meet central mandates, they may be tempted to curtail elections for personal gain. There are certainly strong incentives for cor- rupt oﬃcials to interfere with village election to gain control of the village committee. Control of the village committee facili- tates control of all the village lands (villagers do not own their land, but rather the village does); access to the village coﬀers; the power to assess fees, spend and borrow; and the ability to fabricate or conceal village records. Control of the village land is especially valuable to corrupt oﬃcials when land sales, land leasing, or enterprises are possible. For instance, given the lack of transparency around transactions and accounts, a typical problem is that village oﬃcials will report that village land was sold for much less than the actual price in order to pocket the diﬀerence. Government grants from above may also be skimmed; for instance, farmers in Henan province in particu- lar beneﬁt from direct cash payments for grain subsidies, cash that must ﬁrst travel through the county and village coﬀers, making tempting opportunities for corrupt oﬃcials (Cheung, 2004). Under a rule of mandates, identifying corruption would re- quire, ﬁrst, determining that elections fell short of the law, and second, determining that the reason was not a good faith eﬀort to meet higher targets. Below, I show how diﬃcult it is estab- lish both of these matters, lending support to my theoretical argument that the rule of mandates system veils corruption through imposing a higher information requirement for iden- tifying corruption. (a) Description of the data To understand the extent of interference in village elections and assess the possibility that corruption plays a signiﬁcant role, I use original survey data from the 2005–06 China Village Democracy Survey in Shandong and Henan. Shandong and Henan provinces border each other, well-represent China’s heartland, and at the time of the survey were the country’s two largest provinces; together, they encompassed 14% of the country’s enormous population. The multilevel spatial sur- vey was collaboratively designed and implemented; analyses are my own. The data are usual in their depth of political con- tent, and also in containing village- and township-level infor- mation on top of individual-level information. It includes individual surveys of 574 respondents over 14 townships and 26 administrative villages; qualitative interviews with the vil- lage leaderships; village election historical data; and interviews with supervising township oﬃcials in China’s two most popu- lous provinces. These data are not suﬃcient to establish where corruption really occurred—though it would be ideal to examine data that could do so in a future study. Yet, it is suﬃcient to test the the- ory that corruption is veiled under a rule of mandates, that is, that because of relative standards of accountability, it is near impossible to distinguish corruption from mandate-compli- ance. 4. DETERMINING IMPLEMENTATION UNDER A RULE OF MANDATES Simply determining whether or not a law was implemented can be a challenge in China’s system of top-down oversight, which relies largely on reports by cadres who may have an incentive to mislead higher oﬃcials. Information that is re- vealed by the public—through petitions, protests, hotlines, and other self-initiated contact with oﬃcials—is frequently used as a check on reports that lower oﬃcials provide. In exceptional situations, investigatory teams may be sent to spe- ciﬁc locations to collect more information from locals, but ordinarily higher oﬃcials would not have much access to the information that villagers have on the local implementation of laws, as it is too costly to systematically collect, as we have done in the China Village Democracy Survey. Yet, much information is lost when the party relies so heavily on internal reports, as discrepancies often exist between the reports of cadres and the reports of villagers, sometimes substantial ones. As shown in the charts below, local oﬃcials seem to over-re- port the degree to which they implement elections laws. As Ta- ble 1 shows, oﬃcial records on the village elections in the China Village Democracy Survey indicated that all the villages had held elections. However, when interviewed, village leaders in one village admitted theirs had never been held. Moreover, the quality of the elections is often not in accordance with the national law, which demands that 100% of registered adult vil- lagers be allowed to vote. When asked if they were allowed to vote in the village election, in only 38% of the villages did 100% of registered adult villagers say they were allowed to vote. While enfranchisement was generally high, it was not uniformly so. In 15% of the villages, less than two thirds of registered adult villagers said they were allowed to vote. Among the reasons why villagers were eﬀectively disenfran- chised were “there was no election,” “only the men vote,” “only party members vote,” “only one member of each house- hold can vote,” and “I was never informed that there was an election.” From the standpoint of higher leaders, the fact that many villagers are eﬀectively disenfranchised is not a central con- cern. The mandates do not require that the letter of the elec- tion law is upheld, although they generally seem to award credit for holding an election on schedule, require 50% turnout for elections to be deemed “successful,” and award modest bo- nuses for meeting an array of other conditions. For instance, extra evaluation points might be obtained for holding the elec- tions within a certain timeframe or should it produce a winner who is a party member. Local oﬃcials are even brasher in misrepresenting the nom- ination process that they employ in village elections. As Table 2 shows, oﬃcial records on the village elections in the China Vil- lage Democracy Survey indicated that 85% of the villages had held a “sea election”-style (haixuan) nomination, that is, a nomination in which all villagers are eligible to vote for who they want the candidates to be. Yet, in only 69% of villages DECENTRALIZATION AND VEILED CORRUPTION UNDER CHINA’S “RULE OF MANDATES” 59', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='did village leaders make the same claim when interviewed. Meanwhile, only 15% of surveyed villagers across the villages reported being allowed to participate in a nomination process. In all, in 92% of villages, leaders or village records claimed a sea election nomination was held even though the reports from vil- lagers did not sustain the idea that a true sea election nomina- tion had happened in any of them. In 23% of villages, no one surveyed said they could participate in the nomination process, and in only one village did more than a third of surveyed villag- ers say they could participate in the nomination process. The discrepancy between the reports and the reality might be driven by the contradictory mandates that lower leaders face. While they are encouraged to hold sea election nominations—indeed, it is the oﬃcial policy in Shandong province—they are also held accountable for which types of people win the elections and the actions they might take later, so they have strong incentives from their mandates to control the openness of the nomination process in reality. Alternatively, they might choose to control the elections for reasons of corruption—a possibility taken up in the next section. The data above suggest how diﬃcult it is for the government to obtain accurate information on whether laws are being fully implemented. But the diﬃculty that higher oﬃcials face in assessing the performance of local oﬃcials is far greater than this problem alone. Under a rule of mandates, to detect cor- rupt behavior, the party must determine not only whether laws were ignored, but also why. As the next section shows, this is a massive additional challenge. 5. SUSPECTING CORRUPTION UNDER A RULE OF MANDATES When oﬃcials fail to implement the elections law, is it be- cause other mandates take priority or because the oﬃcial is corrupt or sheltering corrupt oﬃcials? Both are plausible. On the one hand, limiting the competitiveness of the elections reduces the probability that villagers could elect assertive vil- lage leaders who would stand in the way of the highest-priority mandates, like political stability, or the implementation of the one-child policy, or the pursuit of economic growth over eco- nomic equity. On the other hand, limiting the competitiveness of the elections increases the likelihood that corrupt oﬃcials can control the village committee with an eye to raiding the village coﬀers or making under-the-table real estate deals over valuable village land. In this section, I show how lower level oﬃcials in our sample normally explained their violations of village elections laws as Table 1.

       " Document(page_content='being in the interests of stability, when they explained it. Whether their claims are true or not is diﬃcult to assess— which is precisely the problem that higher oﬃcials face when trying to identify corruption by lower oﬃcials. One piece of evi- dence that is suggestive of either corrupt or incompetent behav- ior is that interference with village elections does not seem to produce the results claimed; that is, interference does not in- crease stability over time. This evidence cannot conclusively re- veal why interference actually occurred; but the point of this analysis is not to actually do so, but rather to reveal how diﬃ- cult it is to ascertain why oﬃcials violate elections laws. (a) Township interference in village elections Because township governments—the level of government di- rectly above the village level—are charged with overseeing vil- lage elections, in this section I analyze what causes townships to limit the implementation of village elections, and to dismiss or replace elected leaders. To do so, I analyze the qualitative reports from each of the villages in the sample. These reports are based on both close-ended interviews with township oﬃ- cials and open-ended interviews of village heads and village party secretaries, both conducted as part of the China Village Democracy Survey. One of the most striking revelations from these interviews is the astonishing amount of township inter- ference in village elections and the results. The interference, when explained, is usually justiﬁed by the purpose of main- taining “social stability,” the euphemism in China for the pre- vention of collective citizen activity and civic unrest, as shown in Table 3. The open-ended interviews underscore the enormous impor- tance of concerns about social stability in how the township engages with village politics and, in particular, implements vil- lage elections. Most townships seem to believe holding elec- tions will foment rather than limit further unrest. For instance, one township refused to allow a village election after villagers successfully petitioned them to dismiss a corrupt vil- lage leader. There is not clear evidence that the township was pursuing corrupt ulterior motives through its actions; after all, it supported the villagers in dismissing the allegedly corrupt leader. Rather, it seems to have wanted to avoid the possibility that villagers might collectively petition again—something that would be a black mark on the township’s record—by removing any ﬂashpoints for grievances. In doing so, the township overstepped the bounds of the law, but not necessar- ily the mandates, by refusing to hold the election. When the targets that are set up in China’s rule of mandates system are taken into account, the power and propensity of Table 2.

       " Document(page_content='the townships to violate elections laws makes sense. With so- cial stability such a critical target for local oﬃcials, townships seem to try to do as little as possible to rock the boat—which may mean avoiding elections much of the time or ignoring problems around them. For example, a top village oﬃcial re- ported that township oﬃcials did not bother to organize a sec- ond round of a recent election after the initial vote was unsuccessful, reportedly due to ballot stuﬃng. Instead, they asked the incumbent village head, who was not even seeking re-election, to continue in oﬃce. In another township, a top village oﬃcial reported that the township had asked the elected village head to resign in the name of social stability, after some election problems that the township had earlier de- clined to resolve led to villager complaints. He refused, yet the instance demonstrates the township’s disregard for the na- tional village elections law that only permits the voting public to recall elected oﬃcials, as well as its reactivity to potential instability. Much of the time, the actions of the township in the survey were justiﬁed as necessary to block or remove corrupt oﬃcials who might create local instability. Sometimes, townships seem to benevolently remove corrupt oﬃcials; in one village I visited outside the survey, a village party secretary was dismissed after it was discovered that he had secretly rented out the village hall to a business and was pocketing the rent. Consistent with the claim to be ﬁghting village-level corruption, the evidence is that townships interfere more in elections when there are high levels of local corruption, as measured by the reports of sur- veyed villagers. The relationship shown in Figure 1 is a statis- tically signiﬁcant one. But what is not clear from this data is whether townships typically interfere to deter and punish cor- rupt oﬃcials—versus to protect and assist corrupt allies. Certainly, cases in which allegedly corrupt townships inter- fere with village elections are widely reported in China. For in- stance, in another village that I visited outside the survey sample in Shandong province, higher oﬃcials allegedly refused to provide villagers with the legally required levels of compen- sation for land seizures, keeping the money for themselves.

       " Document(page_content='After an independent elected village head challenged them to provide the compensation and produce the past village accounting books, the next village election date was conve- niently moved by a year for supposedly administrative rea- sons, and widespread bribery ensued. Some villagers claim the township orchestrated the bribery, which they say ensured that the independent village head lost his re-election bid to a township lackey. The corruption accusations are unresolved, but resemble many other stories in which township oﬃcials control elections in order to sell land in a corrupt deal, or fake village records in order to skim funds rightfully belonging to villagers. Within the survey sample itself, the evidence also suggests not all townships intended to uphold stability or other high- priority mandates when they curtailed the implementation of elections, removed elected oﬃcials, or appointed oﬃcials to supposedly-elected oﬃces. Villagers and village leaders in one surveyed township have accused it of being in league with local maﬁas. What we know from the aggregate data is that the elections in one of their villages failed after the alleged widespread illegal use of proxy voting, the alleged cooperation of corrupt election oﬃcials, a spontaneous villager protest at the election, and the dramatic theft of one of the ballot boxes with all its ballots. The township responded by annulling the election and taking over the village government directly, ﬁlling the posts with township oﬃcials. From the standpoint of high- er oﬃcials, the township’s actions may seem designed to pre- vent further demonstrations, contention, public accusations, and such “instability.” Yet those same actions might instead, or in addition, be sheltering the corruption of township oﬃ- cials who could have orchestrated the ballot box theft so that they could install their own people in control of the village. The evidence is inconclusive. But this example well-illustrates that one price of a rule of mandates system is a substantially reduced ability to monitor and check corruption. At least in a rule of law system, deviations from the law would be easily recognized as corrupt or suspect. In a rule of mandates system, they are likely to be given the beneﬁt of the doubt—making corruption both more pervasive and harder to root out. There is a further reason to wonder if some townships in the survey are acting in a corrupt manner when they undermine elections: township interference in village elections does not seem to decrease friction between village leaders and the pub- lic, as one might expect it to do if done in order to achieve so- cial stability or root out corrupt elements. As Figure 2 shows, township interference does not increase the extent to which vil- lagers trust the village committee members, who are legally supposed to be elected. That relationship is statistically insig- niﬁcant; and if anything, the raw data seem to suggest a pos- sible negative relationship, which would be consistent with corrupt behavior. That said, because the n of this analysis is small, containing 26 villages, it is possible that a larger n is nec- essary to detect the true relationship if the true relationship is not strong. Yet, even if this is so, the weakness of the relation- ship is consistent with the idea that township interference has limited impact either way, implying either a corrupt motiva- tion or limited ability, and underscoring the diﬃculty of deter- mining whether illegal township actions are corrupt or mandate-complying. Altogether, the qualitative and quantitative data underscore that it is highly diﬃcult to obtain information on why the elec- tions law was poorly implemented. Local oﬃcials often claimed that their interference with village elections was for the purpose of promoting one of the highest priority man- dates, namely political “stability,” even as the evidence is that their interference does not do so. Case study evidence suggests that local oﬃcials may actually sometimes be hiding behind the mandates to shelter their own corruption. While we cannot say for certain whether this happened in the surveyed villages nor estimate the extent to which it happens, the relevant point is that it is very hard to tell why lower oﬃcials do what they do. And yet, under a rule of mandates system, it is essential to know what oﬃcials’ motives are since the standard for corrup- tion becomes a relative one. That is, the very same type of vio- lation of the village elections law would be viewed diﬀerently by overseeing oﬃcials depending on the motive. If the devia- tion from the national elections law were driven by an attempt to meet higher mandates given local circumstances, it would not be considered to constitute an “abuse of public oﬃce for private gain.” Otherwise, it would be considered corruption, invoking the same deﬁnition. Higher level oﬃcials would have the same diﬃculties that we confront here in trying to determine why township oﬃcials curtail village elections. Under a rule of mandates system, mandate-driven variations in the implementation of the elec- tion law are very diﬃcult to distinguish from corruption-dri- ven variations in implementation. 6. IMPLICATIONS In the paper, I have argued that China’s rule of mandates paradigm makes it particularly diﬃcult to identify corrupt oﬃ- cial behavior with certainty in China. The problem is not that the party has less information on its oﬃcials than it would un- der a rule of law paradigm, but rather that more information must be processed to identify corrupt behavior. Since a rule of mandates encourages oﬃcials to adjust the implementation of laws and policies in order to meet priority targets, variation in implementation is not an innate problem. In such a system, for all but the highest priority issues, oﬃcials must also know why variation occurred in order to determine how likely it is that corruption is present. A rule of mandates thus eﬀectively veils corruption. What are the implications of this research for approaches to ﬁghting corruption? Here I discuss, ﬁrst, that it underscores how the relationship between decentralization and corruption depends on broader governing institutions. Second, I discuss the possibility that a rule of mandates might be used in devel- -1 -.5 0 .5 1 1.5 Change in Trust in Village Committee 2003-2005 0 1 2 3 4 Township Interference in Village Elections Figure 2.

       " Document(page_content='opmental ways yet still destabilize over the long term. Here, I raise the question of whether it may be possible to strategically shift the locus of predatory corruption away from priority is- sue areas even as overall corruption is harder to control over the long term. Third, I discuss whether new models of anti- corruption reforms are needed for a rule of mandates. (a) How governing institutions shape the impact of decentralization on corruption A rule of mandates governing system represents a non-law- based form of decentralization in which some aspects of polit- ical accountability remain centralized, especially the determi- nation and enforcement of political priorities, even as other dimensions may be highly decentralized. This balance of cen- tralization and decentralization serves a purpose; it drives variations in the local implementation of laws in such a way that they serve regime priorities. Others have noted that the system of cadre accountability in China is robust, even when regime priorities change dramatically (Nathan, 2003); for in- stance, when top leaders switched their objectives from build- ing a communist state to building a capitalist state, the system responded (Heimer, 2006). Yet, attention has not been brought to how, given an agenda that is set at the top, the sys- tem contributes to diﬃculties in observing and thus controlling corruption. One of the main lessons of this paper is that cor- ruption may be particularly diﬃcult to root out in a political system like China’s, because the governing system inherently imposes a higher information requirement for detecting cor- ruption. This ﬁnding contributes to an emerging literature on the im- pact of decentralization and governing systems on corruption. To date, much of the research on how governing institutions aﬀect corruption has focused on democratic and/or liberal institutions (Svensson, 2005), such as the design of electoral systems (Kunicova & Rose-Ackerman, 2005; Persson & Tabel- lini, 2004) and press freedom (Besley & Burgess, 2001; Brunetti & Weder, 2003). Similarly, much research on how decentral- ization aﬀects corruption has taken place in democratic and/ or law-based contexts. This has illuminated a debate about whether and when improved accountability occurs under cen- tralization versus decentralization (Bardhan, 2002; Gerring & Thacker, 2004; Seabright, 1996). Yet non-law-based contexts also merit further independent attention as they may contain diﬀerent dynamics, as I hope I have shown in this paper. As I discuss below, these distinct dynamics may imply a diﬀerent pattern of impact and call for diﬀerent anticorruption strate- gies. (b) Is a rule of mandates developmental, corruption-enhancing, or both? While this paper has been about the detection of corruption, it also raises an intriguing pair of hypotheses about the impact of corruption on development and stability in China. Since oﬃcials might care to shift corrupt behavior into less detecti- ble arenas, could it be that the rule of mandates moderates the nature of corruption in high priority versus lower priority arenas? At the same time, since the rule of mandates veils cor- ruption, might it increase the aggregate amount of corruption? These hypotheses present avenues for further research and speak to major debates in the literature. One major puzzle about China is how development has pro- ceeded so rapidly in recent decades even as the state has been characterized as extensively corrupt. Some have postulated that corruption might be less harmful in China, perhaps due to high party discipline or a particular cultural heritage (Rock & Bonnett, 2004; Sun, 2004; Svensson, 2005). While illuminat- ing, this literature has had diﬃculty explaining why China’s top-down monitoring and disciplining system would be inef- fective at controlling corruption if party discipline is so high (Dimitrov, 2005) despite an array of apparently sincere anti- corruption reforms in recent years (Wedeman, 2012; Yang, 2004). Similarly, it is puzzling that economic development tar- gets do not incentivize more eﬀective anticorruption work when corruption might threaten development and develop- ment is a high priority mandate (Manion, 2004). The concept of a rule of mandates oﬀers a possible explanation for why there is party discipline in achieving high priority goals along- side enormous diﬃculty in identifying and ﬁghting corruption. The mandates may eﬀectively demand that a few high priori- ties are met, even as the resultant relative standards for cor- ruption help veil corruption. At the same time, the degree to which corruption is veiled by a rule of mandates—and thus patterns of corruption—might vary between the highest priority issues and lower priority is- sues. Since veto targets are mandatory or near mandatory, whereas other targets are discretionary, the simple existence of deviations from veto targets are suﬃcient to constitute red ﬂags for corruption or incompetence, whereas reliably detecting corruption in other arenas requires information on the reasons for deviations. This raises the question of whether a rule of mandates shifts corruption out of high priority areas into lower priority ones, or perhaps changes the nature of cor- ruption from predatory to developmental forms in high prior- ity areas. Comparative evidence already suggests that oﬃcials will shift corrupt activities away from higher detection activi- ties toward lower detection activities (Bardhan, 1997). For in- stance, large infrastructure projects may harbor more corruption because it is easier to maintain secrecy in this arena (Shleifer & Vishny, 1993). Research in China indicates that patterns of corruption and developmental activities are responsive to institutional restructuring (Ang, 2012; Chen, 2004). Further research might explore whether a rule of man- dates limits predatory corruption in veto-target, highest prior- ity areas in China (where less information is needed to detect corruption due to more absolute standards for corruption) even as it might increase it overall and in other areas (where more information is needed to detect corruption due to rela- tive standards for corruption). In doing so, such research would also help elaborate the particular costs and beneﬁts of a rule of mandates. (c) Political stability and anticorruption reforms under a rule of mandates How can eﬀective anticorruption measures be pursued un- der a rule of mandates system? This study implies that reforms should look for ways to diminish the additional monitoring problem that is created by the system’s relative standard for corruption. Also, since mandates regulate which laws are implemented, reforms should engage the mandates system, not simply the legal system. Two prescriptions that are typi- cally applied in rule of law situations—limiting the discretion given to local oﬃcials and enlisting the public in actively over- seeing local oﬃcials—are solutions that may be especially dif- ﬁcult to apply under a rule of mandates, as I discuss below. When it comes to village elections, reports to higher oﬃcials contain inaccurate—sometimes highly inaccurate informa- tion—on the implementation of provisions of the elections law. Reports from villagers may be more reliable but are cost- lier to obtain and interpret. Yet might there be a way for the 64 WORLD DEVELOPMENT', metadata={'author': 'Mayling Birney', 'year': '2014', 'title': \"Decentralization and Veiled Corruption under China's {\\\\textquotedblleft}Rule of Mandates{\\\\textquotedblright}\", 'journal': 'World Development'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='party to reduce the costs of collecting and applying villagers’ local knowledge by, for instance, institutionalizing more par- ticipatory processes? After all, comparative research has shown that one of the most eﬀective ways of preventing cor- ruption is to institutionalize local public oversight using dem- ocratic processes, at least under a rule of law paradigm. Unfortunately, unlike under a rule of law, higher leaders in a rule of mandates system do not seem to have incentives to directly enlist the independent public, media and civil society as monitors of corrupt oﬃcials. An authoritarian rule of mandates system makes it harder for the public to play a useful role in identifying corrupt oﬃcials. In part, this is because the authoritarian regime is generally wary of allowing the public to organize around corruption concerns, especially as the public might be inclined to seize the oppor- tunities with ferocity as they have in decades-past anti-cor- ruption mass campaigns (Li, 2001). Yet, even beyond this are diﬃculties particular to the rule of mandates environ- ment. First, the public does not generally know the man- dates that local oﬃcials are given, so they have no way to judge how conscientiously an oﬃcial met the mandates. So, while higher oﬃcials may wish to collect the information that locals have on local conditions—through welcoming and recording complaints for instance—they have no reason to expect that the public, politically excluded as it is, could distinguish between mandate-driven and corruption-driven behavior by oﬃcials who fail to implement laws. Second, if the public were told the particulars of the mandates, many might object to the priorities implicit in them, exacerbating the party’s diﬃculties. Indeed, the public’s own policy prior- ities are diverse and often diﬀer from the priorities in the mandates. For instance, while the central mandates most strongly prioritize order and economic growth, 51% of respondents thought that rights protections should be among any society’s top two priorities, and 24% thought that public participation should be. Another policy solution that could make it easier to monitor local oﬃcials would be to give them less discretion in deciding how to pursue their mandates. Indeed, corruption control measures often emphasize the need to limit the discretion given to lower oﬃcials. Of course, such a policy would be diﬃcult for China to implement because it undermines a crucial fea- ture of the rule of mandates paradigm, which is that lower oﬃ- cials must have the ﬂexibility to adjust which laws and policies they follow in order to focus on the highest priority outcomes. This paradigm has beneﬁts for the Chinese regime that it may be loathe to part with in the short term. For one, it helps the regime to achieve high priority outcomes without central oﬃ- cials having to understand speciﬁc local areas of the country. Second, as I have argued elsewhere, it stabilizes the regime in the short run by preventing the unwanted spillover eﬀects of policies like village elections. In the long run, however, if the system consistently faces overwhelming information challenges in detecting corrup- tion—as I have suggested in this paper—the rule of mandates may undermine China’s long-term prospects. In the end, the policies that are needed to greatly reduce corruption in China may not be neutral or quick ﬁxes. Rather they may need to be fundamentally related to political reform, not only in terms of methods of choosing and overseeing oﬃcials, but also in terms of whether oﬃcials are held to absolute or relative standards. Further research is needed to determine empirically how much corruption is sheltered by a rule of mandates system, to mea- sure the extent of any development beneﬁts or costs of a rule of mandates, and to assess the extent to which various reforms might help ﬁght corruption. Yet, I hope that this study has laid out clear reasons to believe that a rule of mandates system helps to veil oﬃcial corruption. REFERENCES Alpermann, B. (2003).

APPENDIX A The Village Democracy Survey in Shandong and Henan was implemented in three stages, beginning in November 2005, as a collaborative eﬀort with the Research Center on Contempo- rary China at Peking University, Pierre Landry, and Shiru Wang. Stage One was an in-person survey of a random sample of individuals in Shandong and Henan. These individuals were selected through a geographic sampling technique that pro- ceeded as follows: within each of the provinces (Shandong and Henan), seven counties were selected at random according to a population-density weighting scheme that made it more likely that densely populated counties would be selected. With- in each county, a township was selected at random, again according to a population-density weighting scheme. Within each township, two geographic squares, delineated by GPS measurements, were randomly selected; and the dwellings within those squares were enumerated. In practice, the 28 geo- graphic squares, 14 in each province, encompassed 26 villages, 13 in each province. This is because, in two townships, both of the selected geographic squares randomly happened to fall within the same large village. Within each of the dwellings in- cluded in the ﬁnal sample, one resident was randomly chosen to be interviewed. Because the interviews were conducted in person and multiple attempts were made to contact each indi- vidual, the overall response rate to the survey is quite high, at about 65%. One township was resurveyed in November 2006, as some rural respondents had originally been inadvertently administered an urban version of the survey. In Stage Two, qualitative interviews were conducted of the Village Committee Chairs (Village Heads) and Village Party Secretaries of the administrative villages included in the sur- vey. Shiru Wang conducted these personally in November and December 2005. Knowledgeable residents were also inter- viewed about village facts and local politics, by the team lead- ers and enumerators in charge of the individual level survey. Information from these additional interviews provides a qual- itative supplement to the leadership interviews. In Stage Three, which took place in November 2006, all of the townships in the sample were re-visited; and a survey was administered to a senior township leader with the respon- sibility for overseeing village elections. At the same time, de- tailed election histories were collected on all the villages in the sample, through township and village oﬃcial records where available, along with interviewing of local oﬃcials. (a) Individual-level survey questions used to measure village election implementation The following measures were used to assess the quality of the latest Village Committee election. These measures were constructed from the responses to individuals’ survey ques- tions, speciﬁed below, or from information from qualitative interviews, as noted. (i) Latest election—contestation Qualitative information from leadership interviews was used. (ii) Latest election—enfranchisement Responses to the following questions were used, in combina- tion, to determine the percentage of villagers, by village, who believed they were welcome to vote in the election. C4: Have you ever voted in a Village Committee election? C4a: Why haven’t you voted? Is it because you don’t have the right to vote, or for another reason? (open-ended responses noted) C10: Did you vote in the last village election? C10a: Why didn’t you vote in the last village election? (open-ended responses noted) (iii) Latest election—nomination openness C11: In the last election, could you directly nominate a candidate? (b) Survey questions used to measure township intervention Township checkpoints for intervening in village elections (asked of township oﬃcial in charge of election oversight). A count index (0, 1,2, 3) was created to represent the num- ber of checkpoints revealed in response to the questions below.

Since previous scholars have never investigated the relationships between political turnover and environmental governance at the municipal level, in this work, we proxy pollution by SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx and examine whether environmental performance affects the political turnover of the municipal party secretary by exploiting a panel conditional logit with a fixed-effect model for the period 2002–2013. The results indicate that environ- mental performance does not significantly impact the turnover of municipal party secretaries, offering evidence that an increase of SO2 is associated with the likelihood of promotion under the panel multinomial logit approach. However, a higher GDP growth rate plays the determinant factor affecting the promotion of China’s municipal party secretaries. Specific policy recom- mendations are proposed in accordance with our empirical findings. Keywords Environmental performance . Political turnover . Municipal party secretary . China .

P18 Introduction After China initiated its policy reforms and opened up its country to international markets, the central government turned to economic construction and highlighted the principle of Bdevelopment is the only way,^ generating the demand for stable economic growth. Over the last few decades, China has created its own distinct Beconomic miracle^ through bright economic performances, and this phenomenon has attracted the interests of many scholars. Some studies attribute this mir- acle to the incentive mechanism of economic growth under the situation of China’s special political system. For instance, Blanchard and Shleifer (2001) emphasize the importance of political incentive or career concern to explain the great eco- nomic contribution of Chinese local officials. They indicate that China’s central government responds swiftly to reward or punish local officials according to their local economic performances and thus promote the local economy, implying complementary relationships between economic growth and political promotion of local officials. Easterly (2005) notes that the growth generation needs the Bright incentives,^ be- cause people do respond to incentives, and any factors that impact the incentive mechanism will eventually influence economic growth. Political promotions have indeed been regarded as one of the most important career objectives of government officials. In gen- eral, most previous scholars have pointed out that political turn- over of government officials is usually linked with their econom- ic performances. For example, Li and Zhou (2005) investigate that the likelihood of provincial leaders’ promotion is positively influenced by their economic performance, but there is the Responsible editor: Nicholas Apergis * Chun-Ping Chang cpchang@g2.usc.edu.tw Gen-Fu Feng fgf@mail.xjtu.edu.cn Minyi Dong dondmy-123@163.com Jun Wen wjun1978@163.com 1 School of Economics and Finance, Xi’an Jiaotong University, Xi’an 710049, Shaanxi, China 2 Shih Chien University at Kaohsiung, Kaohsiung 845, Taiwan Environmental Science and Pollution Research https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-018-2499-8', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='likelihood of termination when economic performance turns down. Additionally, Zang (2001) states that the promotion of officials is determined by the performance of governance, which is commonly composed of economic, social, and political per- formances. There are also more similar arguments proposed by Chen et al. (2005), Easterly (2005), Xu et al. (2007), Xu and Wang (2010), Feng and Wu (2013), as well as Wu and Chen (2016). However, along with the notion of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC), economic growth commonly accom- panies environmental degradation (Ang 2007; Jalil and Mahmud 2009; Soytas and Sari 2009; Acaravci and Oztark 2010; Apergis and Payne 2010; Lean and Smyth 2010). For example, Gozgor et al. (2018) observe that both the renewable and non-renewable energy consumption significantly and positively influence the economic growth; Cai and Guo (2009) construct a dynamic model and demonstrate a positively linear relationship between GDP per capita and pollutant emissions when holding green technical progress and environmental invest- ment constant. While this indicates that rapid economic growth likely affects the sustainable development of the environment, most studies up to now simply focus on interactions between the political turnover of officials and their economic perfor- mance, with most of them ignoring the linkages among politi- cians’ turnover and environmental governance. During the period of China’s miraculous growth, local of- ficials have taken up active roles in several aspects, such as promoting reform of the economic system, strengthening re- gional economic cooperation, building infrastructure, devel- oping the private economy, and attracting investment. Therefore, the key issue for the incentive mechanism of China’s economic growth is the efficiency incentives offered to local officials. Qian and Roland (1998) point out that both the reform of decentralization and the fiscal responsibility system are crucial sources of incentives for local governments. However, Zhou (2007) holds a different view, putting forward that simple decentralization in an administra- tion and finance cannot be deemed as an efficient incentive mechanism for local officials; political promotion incentives should be deemed as an important factor to analyze how local governments push economic development. In a similar vein, some scholars indicate that fiscal revenue is very important for local officials, but they are more concerned about opportuni- ties of promotion during their political career; thus, promotion incentives make up the most direct incentive mechanism for local officials versus decentralization in administration and finance (Blanchard and Shleifer 2001; Maskin et al. 2000). Moreover, Xu et al. (2010) investigate that local officials tend to enact policies that are conducive to local economic growth, in response to political incentives. In this context, the criteria for promotion of local govern- ment officials attach great importance to regional economic performance as well (Chen and Lu 2010). Previous studies also note that the turnover of Chinese officials is mostly influenced by their economic performances. Whiting (2001) demonstrates that, in the early stages, Chinese cadres are eval- uated according to their economic performances by listing a lot of anecdotal evidence. Moreover, traditional works have also identified that greater economic performances enhance the likelihood of local leaders’ political promotion, and their likelihood of being terminated increases when local economic performances decrease.1 Zhang (2005) states that the reform of the cadre and personnel system has created an efficient incentive mechanism for political promotion of local govern- ment officials. Furthermore, a measurable view of achieve- ment has been developed along with decentralization of au- thority and tax-sharing in the financial system. Zhou (2004) similarly proposes the concept of Bpolitical tournaments,^ which refer to political promotion games among the same level of local officials, whether at the provincial level or municipal level.2 He points out that those local officials not only compete with each other for political promotion but also for regional GDP growth and taxation in the economic sphere (Tong and Song 2012). In this way, Xu (2011) indicates that political promotions of government officials in China’s regional areas (such as provinces, municipalities, counties, and town- ships), are closely related to their economic performances. Moreover, Maskin et al. (2000) state that the political status of a Chinese province is closely related to its provincial economic ranking, implying that regional government officials have mo- tivations to improve economic performance for the sake of their area’s performance rankings as well. While focusing on provincial investigations, Chen et al. (2005) analyze the relationship between performance valuation and the turnover of provincial leaders, proving that the promotion of provincial leaders hinges on provincial economic performances. Similarly, Feng and Wu (2013) in- vestigate the roles of economic factor, non-economic factor, and personal characteristics in the promotion evaluation mechanism at the provincial level over the period 1978– 2008. Their empirical results find that economic growth per- formance leads to a greater impact on the promotion probabil- ity of lower-ranking officials, while non-economic factors are more important for higher-level officials. He et al. (2014) states that the higher the complete proportion is of the eco- nomic growth target, the greater the probability for political promotion, whereas promotion is the case for the circum- stance of high economic growth targets.3 Alternatively, Earle and Gehlbach (2015) demonstrate that political turnover in the 1 The terminated cases include officials who are replaced, retired, or moving to the same level. 2 Qian and Xu (1993) similarly prove the existence of Bpolitical tournaments.^ Their research investigates that the multidivisional-form structure allows local officials to compete with each other for opportunities of promotion through yardstick competition. 3 However, when the local economic growth target is low, there is no signif- icant relationship between complete proportion and probability of political promotion.

       " Document(page_content='context of weak institutions presents substantial distributional effects that are reflected in economic productivity, using the case investigation of the 2004 Orange Revolution in Ukraine. As an emerging economy, China has maintained an overall fast economic growth over the past several decades, though a certain degree of environmental degradation has accompanied this steadfast growth. The existing incentive mechanism, whose core indicator is local economic performance, has led local gov- ernments to develop their economy regardless of any negative externalities, such as redundant construction and transboundary pollution. Many scholars attach great importance to this issue today, with most having recognized the truth that when economic growth is realized, the policy-making behaviors of local officials simultaneously produce enormous negative impacts on local en- ergy efficiency. Under the incentives of fiscal revenue and op- portunities of promotion, for the sake of attracting foreign capital, local governments compete to lower the threshold of environ- mental conservation. Furthermore, in order to promote local eco- nomic growth and attract investment, local governments may enact preferential policies of land and credit to enterprises and keep down prices of factors of production, thus leading enter- prises to adopt original technology instead of clean technology (Shen and Fu 2006). Cheng and Tsai (2009) investigate heavily polluting coal-fired power plants in Inner Mongolia. Their results show that, in order to enhance economic growth, the government permits those enterprises to construct illegal power plants, which is a this conclusion that agrees with the view of Zhou (2009) in his study. The problem of environmental pollution is widespread in China after several decades of strong growth. The central gov- ernment frequently uses this issue to foster blame on officials and have them take responsibility for such environmental de- terioration. For example, members of the National People’s Congress assert in the Eleventh National Committee of the People’s Political Consultative Conference in 2010 that ac- cording to the political incentives, environmental governance has to be considered in the promotion mechanism of politi- cians.4 The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) acts as the headquarters of the nation’s political system, which has the absolute power to transfer government officials within different layers of state administrations (Bo 2004; Li 2006). In the past, based on the goal of economic construction, the valuation mechanism of local officials’ po- litical promotion was designed on the basis of local economic growth, with environmental governance rarely being taken into consideration. A few papers have discussed the relationship between envi- ronmental governance and political promotion of local officials. For instance, Ran (2013) indicates that there lacks a substantial relationship between environmental governance performance and political promotion of local officials, since most existing environmental performance appraisals are mere formalities and lose their function of political incentive. Wu et al. (2013) state that environmental governance produces a negative impact on political promotion. According to their empirical results, for a one standard deviation increase in investment of environmental improvement (adjusted by average GDP), the likelihood of po- litical promotion for a mayor and secretary, respectively, de- creases by 6.3 and 8.5 percentage points, holding other factors constant. Based on water pollution data of 499 stations located along China’s seven major rivers from 2004 to 2010, Kahn et al. (2015) document evidence that chemical oxygen demand (COD), a measurement of general health of a river, significantly decreased since Chinese central government proclaimed to tie officials’ promotion chances to COD in 2006. Michallet et al. (2015) investigate the process of how political parties adjust the platform towards environmentalism and demonstrate that envi- ronmental concern of political parties is significantly correlated with the country-level economic conditions and their political ideology. Gao and Lei (2016) trace the changes of pollution and energy consumption and their impacts on officials’ promotion, their findings show that energy conservation does not have significant influence on official promotions. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the Eighteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 2012 has taken a momentous decision to emphatically promote the construction of an eco- logical civilization, which means resource consumption, envi- ronmental degradation, and ecological benefit should be includ- ed in the evaluation systems of economic and social develop- ment (Jia 2012). Owing to the appraisal mechanism of political promotion for local officials, which gives priority to local GDP as the standard performance evaluation, competitions among local governments have led to a distortion of local public policy. Thus, environmental conservation, with its obvious externality characteristics, inevitably has become one type of sacrificial public function. Some local governments neglect environmen- tal issues and even sacrifice the environment in exchange for temporary economic growth (Wang and Di 2002; Lv 2014), with the resulting intensification of social conflict now more common in society (Yang et al. 2008). The aforesaid literature shows that most studies investigate the issue of political turnover on the basis of provincial data. Up to the present, scholars have never looked at the municipal level in China to discuss the relationship between political turnover and its possible influence factors, such as environ- mental issues. Therefore, we focus on the municipal level and further explore the relationship between environmental perfor- mance and political turnover of the municipal party secretary.5 This study first adopts the panel conditional logit model with fixed effects to analyze possible influence factors in the pro- motion mechanism of China’s municipal party secretaries, 4 See the details in Jia (2012). 5 The municipal party secretary is the most influential official in a local gov- ernment (Li and Zhou. 2005).

For the sake of the rigor of estimation, we also introduce several demographic variables for whether the leaders ever joined the Chinese Communist Youth League, engaged in jobs related to the communist party, their age, educational level, tenure of party secretary, and population of the cities. Our empirical results show no linkages between municipal environmental performance and political promo- tion of local officials, but economic performance does impact the promotion of municipal officials. The rest of the paper is structured as follows. The section BMethodology^ introduces the econometric methodology adopted. The section BEmpirical analysis^ displays the data source, variable descriptions, and detailed empirical analysis. The section BConclusion and implications^ summarizes the conclusion and offers possible political implications. Methodology The panel conditional logit fixed-effect model As introduced beforehand, the dependent variable of this study is whether a municipal party secretary was promoted in a particular year in a specific city, which means the depen- dent variable is a binary choice variable. Thus, we employ the conditional panel logit fixed-effect model for the estimate. Our model takes the assumption below: yit ¼ 1 if y* yit ¼ 0 if y*it > 0 it ≤0 ð1Þ Here, y* it ¼ μi þ X 0 itβ þ εit. This function can be interpreted as a municipal party secretary being promoted de- pends on observed variables (X), unobserved individual (city) characteristics (μ), and a random error term (ε). The probabil- ity for the promotion of a municipal party secretary that we observe is as follows: P yit ¼ 1 ð Þ ¼ P y* �it > 0 � ¼ P εit > −μi−x 0 itβ � � ¼ F μi þ x 0 itβ � � ð2Þ In order to overcome the problem of incidental parameters, owing to the number of parameters increasing with the num- ber of cities in a fixed-effect model, Chamberlain (1980) pro- poses a conditional logit estimation to condition the likelihood function on a minimal sufficient statistic for the fixed effects, which can be written as follows: L ¼ ΠN i¼1P yi1; ⋯; yiT ∑T ��i¼tyit � � ð3Þ The probability of the observed promotion of a municipal party secretary no longer depends on the fixed effects. Therefore, the coefficients of our variables of interest can be estimated consistently under the conditional logit estimator.6 Promotionit ¼ α þ β1Pollutionit−1 þ β2X it−1 þ ηi þ ϵit ð4Þ Here, Promotion is assigned 1 when the municipal party secretary has moved up from the previous position in that particular year or otherwise, 0; Pollution is the proxy for the environmental pollution variables, including SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx; X is a vector of variables testing our hypoth- eses; ηi indicates city-specific dummies; and εit is an i.i.d. disturbance term, whereby all idiosyncratic factors are cap- tured by the error term. To avoid the problem of simultaneity, all explanatory economic variables are lagged by 1 year in the estimation model. The panel multinomial logit regression model The multinomial logit regression is the most suitable model in a discrete choice analysis, in which a choice set exists that contains more than two alternatives (So and Kuhfeld 1995). This model implies that the decision between two different alternative sets is independent from the presence of more al- ternatives, and this is one of the most important assumptions of the multinomial logit model. Furthermore, it provides use- ful information when determining the correct type of model to estimate multinomial logit equations (Berdiev et al. 2012). For example, Wei et al. (2005) employ a multinomial logit model to investigate the entry modes of foreign direct investment in China, while Levy Yeyati et al. (2010) utilize a multinomial logit approach to test the endogeneity of exchange rate regimes. Let us imagine that there are several situations concerning the political turnover for the municipal party secretary. Hence, for a deeper investigation, the dependent variable is catego- rized as: 1, when the municipal party secretary is replaced; 2, when one’s political career terminates (retirement); 3, when one stays at the same level; and 4, when the party secretary is promoted. In order to fit into the nature of the dependent variable, we employ the panel multinomial logit approach with the fixed- effect model for further investigations. The probability that the 6 The variables that hardly vary over time thus should be excluded in the model (Mierau et al. 2007).

The long sample period helps to trace the performance of local political turnover since major pollutant emissions are embodied in officials’ appraisal mechanism, and it covers several vital time points in terms of environmental governance, for example, indicator COD was embodied into the per- formance appraisal system of officials’ promotion in 2006 (Kahn et al. 2015); according to BControl Program of Total Emission of National Major Pollutants during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan Period^ promulgated by the State Council in 2006, the specific emission control to- wards SO2 and COD are implemented during the period 2006–2010; and China’s central government started to tie promotion opportunities of politicians to the local envi- ronmental quality in 2010 (Jia 2012). Most of the data are obtained from the China City Statistics Yearbook, China Statistical Yearbooks, and China Environmental Statistical database; and the personal ties and credentials of munic- ipal party secretaries come from the China Leading Cadre Database. Table 8 lists the detailed descriptions of vari- ables and data sources. The dependent variable: the classifications of political turnover The dependent variable is the turnover mode of the municipal party secretary. Here, two-way classification is selected in a panel conditional logit model (1 = promotion; 0 = otherwise). To ensure robustness of the empirical results, we use a four- way classification to measure the political turnover in a panel multinomial logit regression (1 = replaced; 2 = retirement; 3 = stays at the same level; and 4 = promotion). Explanatory variables The choice of explanatory variables is governed by the avail- ability of data as well as theoretical issues, and the explanatory variables used herein are introduced below. The first category for explanatory variables is a set of pollution variables, which refer to SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx, respectively. Among them, SO2 is the overall concentration of sulfur dioxide in each city and reflects sulfur dioxide emissions caused by local enterprises during the process of production and fuel combus- tion. The variable COD is an important indicator for control- ling water pollution, and this index is applied to measure the concentration of reducing substances in industrial wastewater. A greater value of COD signifies a high concentration of re- ducing substances in wastewater; furthermore, the major in- gredient for reducing substances is organic contaminant. SOOT refers to the overall concentration of industrial soot and dust, which is caused by fuel combustion of local enter- prises in each city. Finally, NHx is the overall concentration of nitrogen oxides in each city and reflects nitrogen oxide emis- sions caused by local enterprises during the process of pro- duction and fuel combustion. These four explanatory vari- ables serve as measurements of per capita pollution level (di- vided by 10,000 people); the lower the value is for these var- iables, the greater the level will be for local environmental governance. As mentioned in most related research (Li and Zhou 2005; Feng and Wu 2013), a local area’s economic performance is one of the most crucial factors that may influence political turnover (Zhou 2004). We thus follow the previous literature and employ the growth rate of real GDP per capita (GDP, constant in year 2000 and transformed into natural logarithm) to assess the level of economic performance in various cities. We further incorporate additional explanatory variables to measure the professional experience of municipal party secre- taries for efficient estimation. Following Li and Zhou (2005) as well as Opper and Brehm (2007), we consider whether or not the municipal party secretary is a member of the Chinese Communist Youth League (CCYL) to capture potential net- work ties. Hu (2012) investigates the promotion path of 22 municipal mayors and party secretaries in China and finds that 15 out of 22 are members of CCYL. He points out that Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='although CCYL is a mass-based organization, it has the char- acteristics of being quasi-government and is like an adminis- tration; thus, senior members of CCYL usually have greater probability to serve in a local government as party officials after a job transfer.7 CCYL is 1 if the party secretary is a member of CCYL, or otherwise 0. During the 17th CPC National Congress, the Party Central Committee put forward that the promotion mechanism of gov- ernment officials should attach importance to the richness of their political experience. Government officials, who have abundant political qualifications in central ministries and com- missions, large SOEs, and provincial and municipal govern- ments, tend to have a greater probability to be reappointed or promoted. The variable Experience measures whether a mu- nicipal party secretary has ever engaged in a job (such Secretary-General, Deputy Secretary-General, and Director of the Office) related to the party and government work for a professional administration; if yes, 1; otherwise, 0 (Opper and Brehm 2007). We adopt BTenure^ in the estimated model, which describes the time period that the municipal party sec- retary is in office. In China, one completed term for officials is 5 years in general, and reappointment is permitted. Generally speaking, the fourth and fifth years are assumed to be the most crucial period for political promotion since the local officials are normally allowed to make a redeployment only when their term has ended. However, once the municipal party secretary is reappointed to stay in the same level, the likelihood of promotion during the following working life would become extremely low. Thus, we utilize the continuous form of vari- able Tenure and assume that the longer the duration of munic- ipal officials’ tenure, the lower the likelihood of political promotion. According to the BOutline of National Party and Government Leading Group,^ the political leading groups of local governments should maintain the main body of officials to be around 55 years old if a political shuffle happens (Wang et al. 2009). This provision is coincident with the principle that Bthe contingent of cadres should become younger in age.^ Therefore, the age of party secretaries (Age) also presents its influence on the probability of promotion; as stated before, the younger the municipal party secretary is, the higher the prob- ability is for political promotion (Li and Zhou 2005). Moreover, the education level of local government officials can also influence their political careers, as highly educated cadres are preferred following the BOutline of National Party and Government Leading Group.^ Ever since China’s re- forms, Byounger in age^ and Bhighly educated^ have become crucial indicators; thus, high educational background is con- ducive to enhance the probability of political promotion for government officials. The variable Education is a dummy variable defined as 1 if the municipal party secretary has a college education, or otherwise 0. Finally, we follow Opper and Brehm (2007) to control for the size of different cities’ total population (Population, transformed in natural loga- rithm). It is likely that a bigger city size will lead to higher promotion chances for municipal leaders. Empirical results Results of the panel conditional logit model Table 1 reports the descriptive statistics. As can be seen, the mean of Promotion is 0.235, indicating that the likelihood of promotion for municipal officials does not seem to be great in China. Among the pollution variables, SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx, although the difference between their maximum and minimum is large, their means are relatively small. The max- imum and minimum of SO2 are respectively 265.74 and 0.058, but its mean is 26.107, which indicates that most ob- served cities possess a lower level of SO2; the means are 12.644, 11.423, and 1.588 for COD, SOOT, and NHx, respectively. The mean of GDP is 9.934, and its standard deviation is 0.977, implying the economic growth of the observed cities differs very little, and most cities maintain relatively high GDP growth. Age ranges from 48 to 77 and has a mean of 60.99, indicating that most party secretaries are in their 50s or 60s. Table 1 shows that the average Tenure of municipal party leaders is about 2.86 years, varying from 1 to 11 years. For the dummy variables CCYL, Education, and Experience, their conditions appear different. The mean value of CCYL is 0.235, which implies that most municipal party secretaries are not members of CCYL. The mean value of Education is 0.941, indicating that almost all party secretaries have re- ceived a college education. Furthermore, the mean of Experience (0.488) shows that almost half of party secretaries have experienced job related to the party or government. Table 2 displays the means of political turnover and envi- ronmental pollution for all 113 cities. We find that those cities with a relatively higher likelihood of party secretaries being replaced, in retirement, staying at the same level, and experiencing promotion are Handan, Qingdao, Changsha, and Handan, respectively. Furthermore, concerning the pollu- tion variables, evidence shows that SO2, COD, SOOT, and NHx are relatively higher in Jinchang, Lasa, Shizuishan, and Jinchang, while Haikoy, Chifeng, Shantou, and Taizhou enjoy relatively great environmental performance. In the point of linkage between political turnover and environmental pollu- tion, it can be observed that cities with higher likelihood of political promotion tend to suffer severer environmental 7 One of the most important measurements of the promotion mechanism of party officials is Bthe contingent of cadres should become younger in age^. There is a preferential policy towards senior cadres of CCYL during the pro- cess of cadre cultivation and selection. This causes government officials among the same level of cadres, which have the advantage of age, to mostly be members of CCYL.

       " Document(page_content='pollution in general, while such tendency is typically embod- ied in the interaction between promotion likelihood and SO2 emission. Table 3 displays the results of the impacts of SO2 pollution on the likelihood of municipal party secretary promotions, using the conditional logit model. As can be seen, the statistics of P-Hausman in all equations are 0.00, indicating that the fixed-effect model is appropriate. In all estimations, the de- pendent variable is assigned the value of 1 for a promotion, or 0 otherwise. To begin with, in models (1), (3), and (4), the evidence shows that SO2 is statistically insignificant at the 5% level, implying that the SO2 emissions do not have a signifi- cant impact on the promotion of municipal party secretaries in China, while being a member of CCYL increases the likeli- hood of promotion for municipal party secretaries, except for in model (4). More precisely, models (1) and (2) show that the likelihood of political promotion is 1.284 (namely exp (0.25)) times greater for municipal party secretaries who are members of CCYL, comparing to those who are not. However, GDP appears to be statistically significant at conventional levels in most specifications for models (2)–(4); this implies that a higher GDP growth rate usually is combined with a higher likelihood of promotion for municipal leaders. Taking model (2) as an example, a one standard deviation increase in mu- nicipal GDP growth leads to a 62.528 (0.64*0.977) percent- age point increase in the likelihood of promotion. This result reflects the clear effect of economic performance on the like- lihood of promotion in China. These results are also consistent with those of Chen et al. (2005) and Li and Zhou (2005). Regardless of professional experience and personal ties of party secretaries, in model (2), Experience is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level. Surprisingly, in model (3), Experience becomes the most crucial influence factors under such circumstance, that is, the coefficient of Experience is 0.84, implying that the likelihood of promotion is 2.31 (exp (0.84)) times greater for municipal secretaries who have engaged in jobs related to party and government work compared with those who have not. Furthermore, note that the variable Tenure presents strongly negative influence on likelihood of promotion for party secretaries, and a one standard deviation increase in Tenure causes likelihood of promotion to decrease by 124.821 (0.69*1.809) percentage points in model (4). Besides, Age is not statistically significant in both models (2) and (4), implying that age is not a crucial factor during the process of determining turnover mode of municipal party secretary. Finally, both Education and Population are proved to have significant positive impacts on the promotion of party secretary, higher levels of education and bigger size of city increase the likelihood of promotion, these findings are also in line with the Li and Zhou (2005) as well as Opper and Brehm (2007). In a word, based on the above plentiful analysis, it is clear that, in China, the most important factor of political promotion for municipal party secretary is GDP growth but not for the performance of environmental governance in China, this is coincident with the conclusion of Chen et al. (2005). Next, we turn to change the pollution variables as COD, SOOT, and NHx, the results are displayed in Tables 4, 5, and 6. As before, we find that all our pollution variables are statisti- cally insignificant, except for the NHx in model (3) of Table 5, which shows significant negative impacts on the promotion, implying that higher pollutions usually combing with lower probability of officials’ promotion. Similarly, again, greater economic growth expands the promotion of municipal party secretary in all equations, suggesting that higher economic performance lead to a higher probability of implementing a Table 1 Basic descriptive statistical analysis Variable Observations Mean Standard deviation Minimum Maximum Replaced 1353 0.267 0.442 0 1 Same level 1272 0.052 0.222 0 1 Retirement 1351 0.014 0.118 0 1 Promotion 1351 0.235 0.424 0 1 SO2 1326 26.107 28.131 0.058 265.742 COD 1225 12.644 9.636 0.806 172.107 SOOT 1334 11.423 23.075 0.013 710.105 NHx 1333 1.588 1.876 0.114 24.298 GDP 1355 9.934 0.977 0 11.717 CCYL 1337 0.235 0.424 0 1 Experience 1339 0.488 0.500 0 1 Tenure 1353 2.860 1.809 1 11 Age 1352 60.999 5.031 48 77 Education 1335 0.941 0.236 0 1 Population 1350 5.992 0.748 3.37 8.12 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",

Results of the panel multinomial logit regression model We now seek to discover further support for the robustness of our results via the panel multinomial logit approach with a fixed-effect model, where the municipal party secretaries may face a four-way classification about their turnover: 1, if replaced; 2, if into retirement; 3, if at the same level; and 4, if promoted. Hence, the parameters in Table 7 demonstrate the impact of the independent variables on the choice of promo- tion under consideration relative to the baseline category of replaced, retirement, and same level. Table 7 presents the results of estimation. It can be seen that models (1), (2), and (3) only consider the influence of eco- nomic performance on the promotion of municipal party sec- retaries, while models (4), (5), and (6) take the impacts of environmental governance into consideration.

       " Document(page_content='coefficient in the equations, suggesting that a bright economic performance more likely contributes to the promotion of a municipal party secretary relative to those different baseline categories. Again, we provide evidence that economic growth plays a critical role concerning the promotion of municipal partisan leaders. However, when models (4), (5), and (6) in Table 7 include pollution variables, it can be seen that an increase of SO2 is associated with the enhancement of the likelihood of promotion under consideration relative to those being replaced, under retirement, and at the same level. This does not match our anticipation but does imply that higher SO2 emissions are conducive to the promotion of a municipal party secretary, which is similar to the conclusion of Wu et al. (2013). Comparing to COD, SOOT, and NHx, SO2 is the pri- mary source of China’s industrial pollutants, specifically, China’s industrial SO2 emission reached 24.68 million ton and accounted for 86.7% of total industrial SO2 emission in 2007, indicating that SO2 emission tend to have more significant link with industrial production and thus with local economic growth, which may further produce certain impact on political promotion of local officials. It further implies that better environmental governance may harm economic growth, or in other words, higher environmental pollution is conducive to enhanced economic performance, thus increasing the like- lihood of promotion. Furthermore, similar to an earlier find- ing, the parameters of COD, SOOT, and NHx still present weak influence on the turnover mode of municipal party secretary. Concerning the results of other control variables, as antic- ipated, our findings indicate that CCYL and Experience (ex- cept for models 1, 3, and 6) increase the probability of pro- motion, while the variable Tenure shows that a longer length of term has a lower probability of promotion in models (2)–(5). The variable Age also has the expected negative and statistically significant coefficient in all equations, implying that older party secretaries are more likely to lower the Table 3 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, SO2 Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.25 (5.49)** 0.33 (14.12)** 0.92 (23.10)** 0.71 (3.59) ** SO2 0.19 (1.20) 0.29 (0.60) − 0.50 (− 1.40) GDP 0.64 (4.33)** 0.23 (7.62)** 0.57 (7.95)** CCYL 0.25 (2.71)** 0.25 (6.72)** 1.88 (7.00) ** 0.17 (0.70) Experience 0.18 (1.11) 0.07 (2.54)** 0.84 (4.97) ** 1.93 (6.45) ** Tenure − 0.13 (− 0.23) − 0.69 (− 3.61)** Age − 0.01 (− 0.14) 0.51 (1.04) Education 0.33 (3.32)** 0.43 (3.92) ** Population 0.22 (2.33)** 1.44 (2.94) ** Log likelihood − 166.90 − 133.87 − 315.87 − 376.99 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1256 1334 1232 1308 Z statistics in parentheses. ** and * indicate statistical significance at the 5% and 10% levels, respectively; 1 if a municipal party secretary is under promotion; otherwise, 0 Table 4 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, COD Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.18 (3.44)** 0.72 (4.44)** 0.99 (22.92) ** 1.32 (20.89) ** COD − 0.08 (− 0.66) 0.29 (0.60) 0.51 (1.04) GDP 1.03 (6.51) ** 0.25 (3.42)** 0.89 (78.82)** CCYL 0.09 (0.63) 0.84 (3.18)** 0.88 (12.24) ** 2.23 (7.62)** Experience 0.01 (0.04) 0.11 (0.72) 0.89 (78.82) ** 1.88 (7.00) ** Tenure − 1.35 (− 2.49) ** − 0.19 (− 1.20) Age 0.28 (0.80) 0.12 (0.76) Education 1.95 (5.75) ** 0.25 (5.49)** Population 1.25 (6.36)** 0.84 (4.97) ** Log likelihood − 348.14 − 342.31 − 294.35 − 270.31 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1108 1204 1322 1262 Notes: Same as Table 2 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='probability of promotion. We finally demonstrate that Education and Population (except for model (1)) are less like- ly to enhance a promotion with a weak significant effect on the turnover of municipal party secretary. Conclusion and implications By using a panel conditional logit model and multinomial logit regression, this research examines the relationship between environmental governance and political turnover of party secretaries in a panel of 113 cities in China using annual data over the period 2002–2013. Overall, our re- sults demonstrate that most pollution variables do not have significant impacts on the turnover of municipal par- ty secretaries in China. We even offer evidence that an increase of SO2 is associated with the enhancement of the likelihood of promotion when using the panel multi- nomial logit approach. In particular, we provide evidence that a higher GDP growth rate is usually combined with a higher likelihood of promotion for municipal leaders, which also goes for professional experience as well as personal ties as members of the Chinese Communist Youth League. Working experience in the party and gov- ernment also helps the secretaries have a greater probabil- ity of being promoted, whereas a long tenure has a strong negative influence on the likelihood of promotion for par- ty secretaries. Alternatively, evidence shows that age is less likely to influence a promotion, and educational level and city population play insignificant roles in determining the turnover of municipal party secretaries in China. From the conclusions mentioned above, it is clear in China that the performance of environmental governance is not a necessary criterion for promotions of municipal party secretaries; even a more serious environmental con- tamination can lead to the promotion of a municipal party secretary. Like the arguments proposed by Wu et al. (2013), this is mainly because worse environmental Table 5 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, SOOT Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.43(3.92) ** 0.69(3.61) ** 1.44(2.94) ** 6.57(7.95) ** SOOT 0.17(0.70) −0.01(−0.02) 0.04(0.28) GDP 1.93(6.45) ** 1.35(2.49) ** 0.12(2.37)** CCYL 1.72(4.44) ** 0.56 (2.10)** 0.44(1.78)* 0.05(0.45) Experience 1.03(6.51) ** 0.23 (3.10)** 029(5.12)** 0.13(2.09)** Tenure −1.95(−5.75) ** 0.08(0.041) Age 0.11(0.72) 0.37(1.81)* Education 0.28(0.80) 0.43(3.69)** Population 0.33 (9.37)** 0.29(15.79)** Log likelihood −334.98 −321.88 −323.09 −209.03 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1208 1322 1222 1150 Notes: Same as Table 2 Table 6 Pollution and municipal party secretary promotions in China, NHx Model (1) (2) (3) (4) Constant 0.12 (2.83)** 0.11 (1.78)* 0.37 (1.91)* 0.46 (4.20)** NHx 0.06 (0.38) − 0.42 (− 2.15)** 0.15 (1.42) GDP 0.06 (3.47)** 0.09 (3.99)** 0.06 (2.08)** CCYL 0.30 (2.97) ** 0.03 (1.75)* 0.04 (1.85)* 0.96 (2.06)** Experience − 0.02 (− 0.60) 0.16 (6.62)** 0.15 (7.08)** 0.35 (4.07) ** Tenure − 0.08 (− 1.20) − 0.19 (− 3.09)** Age 0.18 (1.06) 0.37 (1.03) Education 0.48 (1.72)* 0.32 (1.08) Population 0.96 (2.06)** 0.35 (4.07) ** Log likelihood − 265.99 − 323.88 − 323.80 − 209.88 P-Hausman test 0.00 0.00 0.00 0.00 Observation 1086 1126 1286 1308 Notes: Same as Table 2 Environ Sci Pollut Res', metadata={'author': 'Gen-Fu Feng and Minyi Dong and Jun Wen and Chun-Ping Chang', 'year': '2018', 'title': 'The impacts of environmental governance on political turnover of municipal party secretary in China', 'journal': 'Environmental Science and Pollution Research'}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='contamination is associated with higher industrial produc- tion and a higher local GDP growth rate, and most offi- cials choose to drive economic growth as a development goal. We thus note that policymakers in both central and local governments should take note of such a phenomenon. We also offer some policy implications from our pa- per’s results. There does not exists obvious relationship between environmental performance and the promotion mechanism of municipal party secretary, mainly because most existing environmental performance appraisals are mere formalities and lose their function of a political in- centive (Ran 2013). However, the results of panel multi- nomial logit regression show that increasing SO2 is linked with higher likelihood of political promotion, implying that intensive industrial production does promote local economy and finally contributes to municipal secretaries’ political promotion. As we stated earlier, local officials’ response to promotion incentives more directly correlate to other mechanisms; therefore, the most efficient way to promote environmental governance in a local area is to link environmental performance with promotions. Thus, the priority is to make local officials pay greater attention on environmental governance, and policymakers in the central government should formulate evaluative indicators for measuring the environmental pollution of municipal- level cities. Furthermore, like most previous studies in the literature have mentioned before, our study also proves that local economic performance is the most crucial factor for officials’ promotion, as the fact that greater economic performance leads to a higher likelihood of promotion. It implies that the most conducive path for local officials’ promotion should be to try and improve environmental governance without hindering local economic growth; the local officials ought to try their best to improve energy efficiency, develop innovative technologies, increase the access to clean energy, and balance the interests between environment and economy.

The fact that many individuals nevertheless participate voluntarily in such elections suggests that people do care about democracy as such. This experiment investigates the value of democratic voting rights by providing participants the chance to sell them. More speciﬁcally, an incentive compatible mechanism is used to elicit the willingness-to-accept value of the voting right in the election of the German Bundestag on 16 October 1994. A postexperimental questionnaire makes it possible to assess the relative importance of answers to the frequently raised question: Why do people vote?', metadata={'title': 'Do people care about democracy?

       "  Document(page_content='We theoretically and experimentally investigate the effect of self-serving information avoidance on moral bias in democratic and individual decisions in the context of climate change mitigation. Subjects choose between two allocations that differ in payoffs and contributions to climate change mitigation. We vary the observability of the environmental contribution, as well as the decision context associated with different levels of pivotality. If the contribution is directly observable, we find evidence for lower pivotality leading to higher levels of “green” decisions, as predicted by the low-cost theory of voting. This effect disappears if subjects can avoid information on the contribution. Instead, we find evidence for the exploitation of moral wiggle room via information avoidance in larger democracies as well as in the consumption context. Our results indicate that information avoidance substitutes expressive voting as an instrument to manage cognitive dissonance on the part of the voter. Hence, moral biases in elections might be less likely than previously thought.', metadata={'title': 'Expressive voting versus information avoidance: experimental evidence in the context of climate change mitigation', 'author': 'Katharina Momsen, Markus Ohndorf', 'keywords': 'Expressive voting · Information avoidance · Experiment · Moral wiggle room · Climate change', 'filename': 'Expressive voting versus information avoidance_expenrimental evidence in the context of climate change mitigation.pdf'}),\n",

We address these debates by examining voter behavior and election outcomes across primary systems in the laboratory. While we ﬁnd the rate of strategic voting is generally low, the rate varies across primary formats and the potential impact on election outcomes differs from conventional perceptions. Results suggest that more open primary systems generate more strategic voting, but contrary to conventional wisdom, more open systems do not necessarily lead to more moderate election winners.', metadata={'title': 'Crashing the party: An experimental investigation of strategic voting in primary elections', 'author': 'TODD L.

In this paper, we examine the effect of local environment regulation outcomes, i.e., local pollution, on leaders ’  chances of promotion. This is an important question because only when the Chinese cadre evaluation system rewards local of ﬁ cials ’  green behaviors, these of ﬁ cials would move away from their past priority in promoting economic growth at all costs, so that the environmental crisis in China might be addressed. We collect party secretary data for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure promotion patterns. We construct county-year SO2 and PM2.5 pollution measures using NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coef ﬁ cient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who are able to reduce air pollution are more likely to be promoted. We  ﬁ nd similar results for county magistrates. However, we do not  ﬁ nd evidence for this pollution-promotion link for prefecture and provincial party secretaries.', metadata={'title': 'Greening the career incentive structure for local of ﬁ cials in China: Does less pollution increase the chances of promotion for Chinese local leaders?', 'author': 'Mingqin Wu, Xun Cao', 'keywords': 'Pollution, Career incentive structure, Local leader promotion, China', 'filename': 'wu2021.pdf'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='The political incentives of local officials affect their preferences for policy options. This study examines the impact of the convening cycle of Provincial Communist Party Congresses (PCPCs) in China on pollution emission intensity. Based on the data of 281 cities and city officials from 2003 to 2014, the present study finds strong evidence of a political pollution cycle manifesting as significant increases in pollution emission intensity before PCPCs followed by visible decreases after PCPCs. PCPCs provide city officials with strong political incentives to pursue short-term economic performance before congresses, which leads to a surge in pollution emission intensity. The difference in pollution emission intensity before and after the PCPCs reveals the existence of such political incentives. The findings suggest that a significant relationship exists between the political incentives of city officials and environmental pollution. Therefore, the effective governance of environmental pollution must involve changing the incentive structure of city officials.', metadata={'title': 'Political incentives, Party Congress, and pollution cycle: empirical evidence from China', 'author': 'Zhihua Tian, Yanfang Tian', 'keywords': 'China; city officials; Communist Party Congress; economic development; political incentives; political pollution cycle', 'filename': 'EPBC1.pdf'})],\n",
