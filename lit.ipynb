    "my_abstract = \"This paper believes that voters often follow the peak-end rule according to the theory of behavioral economics when they make voting decisions. However, at present, there is no relevant research on the relationship between economic voting and peak-end rule. This paper discusses voters’ decision process of using peak-end rule with a cross-nation panel data including 595 national elections in 70 countries from 1960 - 2020. The results show that voters do follow the peak-end rule. The average of highest annual GDP growth rate in the term and the GDP growth rate on final year before the election have positive impact on the vote share of the incumbent party. This paper also finds that voters with lower education level rely more on the peak-end rule. To solve the endogenous problems, this paper introduces an instrumental variable strategy. We introduce the global oil price and the federal fund rate as instrumental variables. \"\n",

       "'Introduction:\\n\\nEconomics is a social science that studies how individuals, businesses, and governments allocate resources to satisfy their needs and wants. It is a field that has been around for centuries and has evolved over time to become one of the most important disciplines in the world. The Journal of Economic Literature is a publication that aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the latest research in economics. In this journal, readers can find articles on a wide range of topics, including macroeconomics, microeconomics, international trade, finance, and more.\\n\\nOne of the most interesting aspects of economics is how it affects our daily lives. From the price of goods and services to the policies that governments implement, economics plays a crucial role in shaping our world. In this journal, we aim to explore the latest research in economics and how it impacts our lives.\\n\\nOne of the articles in this journal explores the value of voting rights. The authors conducted an experiment to measure the values that people assign to their voting rights. The results were surprising, as most participants did not want to sell their voting rights, even at high prices. This article sheds light on why people vote and the importance they place on their right to vote.\\n\\nAnother article in this journal examines the impact of economic growth on the support for extreme political parties in western democracies. The authors argue that the growth rate, but not the level of aggregate income, affects the support for extremism. They develop a game-theoretic model that analyzes the uncertainty effect of extreme political parties on future income distribution. The empirical analysis shows a significant negative effect of real per capita GDP growth on the support for extreme right-wing parties.\\n\\nFinally, this journal also includes an article that explores the impact of primary election rules on voting behavior and election outcomes. The authors examine the various primary rules in different American states and how they impact the nomination process. They use experimental methods to investigate strategic voting in primary elections and how it affects the outcome of the general election.\\n\\nIn conclusion, the Journal of Economic Literature provides a comprehensive overview of the latest research in economics. The articles in this journal explore a wide range of topics and shed light on how economics impacts our daily lives. We hope that this journal will be a valuable resource for economists, policymakers, and anyone interested in understanding the world around us.'"
